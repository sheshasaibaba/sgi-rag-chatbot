 Introduction
                                                                                         1
1. Introduction
Thanks for picking up the Saskatchewan Driver’s Handbook!

Driver training is a rite of passage many of us share. Now that the time has come to
get your driver’s licence, SGI wants to help you get ready. We created this handbook
to teach you the basics, like:
• trafﬁc signs and signals
• the rules of the road
• driving in different weather conditions, like snow, rain and fog
• sharing the road with other vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists

The handbook also covers advanced skills, like how to predict what other drivers
might do, and then how to respond in the moment.

A handy resource for new and experienced drivers alike, study this book before your
test and keep consulting it even after you get your licence. It can help you pass your
driver’s test and lay the groundwork for decades of safe driving.

If we could offer one piece of advice, it’s to get as much practice as you can with
your supervising driver. The conﬁdence gained from hands-on experience behind the
wheel will help you when it’s time for your road test.

Good luck on your path to becoming a great driver.

We’ll see you on the road!

    2. Saskatchewan’s driver’s licence program
    Driver programs and examinations are designed to develop safe and capable drivers
    who know and understand the rules of the road. Driving is a responsibility and a
    privilege. It’s not a right. Provincial regulations exist to meet safety needs as well as
    promote the efﬁcient and safe ﬂow of trafﬁc.

    To drive in Saskatchewan you must hold a valid driver’s licence for the type of vehicle
    you wish to operate. The classiﬁed driver‘s licence system establishes minimum
    standards of skill, knowledge, physical and mental ﬁtness for the safe operation of
    different types of vehicles. Drivers are then licensed accordingly.
    The ﬁrst time you apply for a Saskatchewan driver’s licence, you’ll be asked to provide
    documents to prove your identity, proof of residency and entitlement to be in Canada.
    Each document must be from an authority such as a federal or provincial government
    or a federal agency (a full list of approved documents can be found at
    sgi.sk.ca/identity-and-residency-veriﬁcation and in SGI’s Establishing Your Identity
    pamphlet). They must also be originals, not photocopies. Electronic scans of these
    documents may be kept on ﬁle, in keeping with Canadian standards.

    To get a driver’s licence, you must be able to operate a vehicle safely and properly,
    understand all trafﬁc signs and know the rules of the road. You’re required to
    complete a driver’s examination if you:
    • Have never been a licensed driver;
    • Have not held a Saskatchewan driver’s licence or speciﬁc Class or Endorsement
      within the past ﬁve years;
    • Wish to become a certiﬁed driver instructor in Saskatchewan;
    • Want to change the class of your licence or obtain an endorsement; or
    • Are a new resident, and the licence you hold is from another province, state or country
      not honoured or recognized in Saskatchewan. Licences may be honoured from the
      United States. Licences from Germany, Switzerland, South Korea, the United Kingdom,
      Republic of Ireland, Isle of Man, Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Japan, Jersey,
      Netherlands, New Zealand, Ukraine and Taiwan may be exchanged for a Saskatchewan
      Class 5 driver’s licence and motorcycle endorsement, where applicable. Saskatchewan
      may also accept a driver’s licence from a country not listed. Please check with any
      Saskatchewan motor licence issuer, driver examination ofﬁce, or visit www.sgi.sk.ca/
      newresidents or contact us toll free at 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744). The
      nine-month learning period and driver training requirement may be waived if you can
      prove past driving experience by providing a valid driver’s licence, written in English or
      French, or a valid licence in another language accompanied by a translation document
      acceptable to SGI (i.e. International Driving Permit).

    If you’re a new resident wanting a Saskatchewan driver’s licence without being
    tested, you must meet some requirements:
    • If you’re a former resident of a Canadian province or territory you must have a valid
      driver’s licence from that jurisdiction. An expired driver’s licence (not older than ﬁve
      years) from that jurisdiction is also acceptable. New residents may drive with their
      valid out-of-province driver’s licence for 90 days after moving to Saskatchewan.

    Fake ID
    Do the right thing and only use your own legal driver’s licence or photo ID card. It’s
    a criminal offence to alter a photo ID card or the driver’s licence paper certiﬁcate in
    any way. It may not seem like a big deal, but there are serious consequences to using
    fraudulent ID, or loaning your ID for fraudulent purposes, including:
    • getting your real driver’s licence suspended for at least three months
    • a ﬁne of at least $125
    • a possible fraud conviction under the Criminal Code that could affect your
      employment, your education and chances of travelling outside of Canada
    • getting other people ﬁned, ﬁred or put out of business

      2.2 Vehicle registration



    Liability coverage protects you as a vehicle owner and driver if you and/or your
    vehicle are responsible for injuries caused to others or damage to property belonging
    to others. ‘Others’ may be another motorist, a pedestrian or bicyclist, a passenger in
    your vehicle, or the owner of property you damage.

    To be liable is to be at fault and responsible for damage or injury. You can be
    liable whether you choose No Fault or Tort injury (all Saskatchewan residents are
    automatically covered with No Fault injury coverage unless they choose Tort injury
    coverage and ﬁle a declaration form). Liability coverage will pay the cost to defend
    you if someone claims you are liable, as well as the damages if you are found
    responsible.

    Plate insurance provides up to $200,000 in liability coverage. Although
    compensation for many injuries and damages is covered under the collision
    and comprehensive coverage or the personal injury beneﬁts, there are also many
    situations where compensation will be based on who is at fault, what happened and
    where it happened (for instance, if you were driving in the U.S. or another Canadian
    province). These include damage to buildings or fences near a street, to cargo in a
    vehicle you collide with, or to trains, cargo, and tracks at a level crossing, including
    environmental damage. If you’re responsible for an injury or death in Saskatchewan of
    someone whose earnings were greater than the personal injury beneﬁt amount, or to
    anyone out of province, you will likely have a liability claim.

    No Fault Coverage
    Saskatchewan residents with No Fault Coverage receive a comprehensive package
    of beneﬁts regardless of the circumstances of the collision. Beneﬁts include coverage
    for income loss, medical and rehabilitation expenses, permanent impairment and
    death beneﬁts. Those with No Fault Coverage can sue for certain expenses not
    covered by their beneﬁts, as well as for income loss which exceeds the beneﬁts
    provided by the plan. Except in very limited circumstances, they cannot sue for pain
    and suffering.

    Tort Coverage
    Saskatchewan residents with Tort Coverage receive a basic package of beneﬁts
    regardless of the circumstances of the collision. Beneﬁts include some coverage for
    income loss, medical and rehabilitation expenses, permanent impairment and death
    beneﬁts. Those with Tort Coverage who are not totally at fault for the collision can
    sue for expenses and income losses not covered by their beneﬁts and for pain and
    suffering, subject to a $5,000 deductible.

    For more information on No Fault Coverage, Tort Coverage or how to choose your
    auto injury insurance, visit www.sgi.sk.ca or ask any SGI ofﬁce or SGI motor licence
    issuing ofﬁce for informational materials that explain the coverages.

                                                                                              2
Your vehicle deductible
Your plate insurance covers loss of, or damage to, your vehicle and its equipment
from causes such as a collision, upset, ﬁre, theft, windstorm or hail. Subject to your
deductible.

A deductible is applicable to any vehicle loss you may have. It’s the amount you
are required to pay before your licence plate insurance beneﬁts begin to cover the
remaining costs.

For example, if your deductible is $700 and you’re responsible for a collision which
causes $2,000 worth of damage to your vehicle, then SGI will pay for damage in
excess of your deductible. You’ll be responsible for the ﬁrst $700, while SGI will pay
the remaining $1,300.

However, if it’s determined that another Saskatchewan driver/owner is responsible
for the damage and that person can be identiﬁed, that person’s insurance will pay
for your damage, including your deductible and any other reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses.

Coverage for speciﬁc single-vehicle losses
Single-vehicle collision – Your damages are covered for the amount in excess of your
deductible. You may be able to recover your deductible when there is a responsible
party to pursue. Your adjuster will assist you with this. In most single-vehicle collisions
the driver is responsible and must pay their own deductible.

Storm or weather-related damage – Even though you’re not at fault for weather-
related damage, such as hail damage or a tree falling on your vehicle, the deductible
applies as there is no responsible party to pursue.

Collision with an animal – If you carry only the compulsory plate insurance, the
deductible applies. If you carry additional auto insurance the deductible may be
waived for a collision with an animal.

Hit and run – Your damages are covered for the amount in excess of your deductible.
You may be able to recover your deductible if the responsible party is identiﬁed. Your
adjuster will assist you with this.

Theft or vandalism – If you carry only the compulsory plate insurance, the deductible
applies. If the responsible party is identiﬁed, you may be able to recover your
deductible. If you carry additional auto insurance the deductible may be waived for
theft of the entire vehicle.

Coverage for multiple-vehicle losses
You’re not at fault for the collision – You don’t pay the deductible in most cases. The
party found at fault for the collision is responsible for your damage, including your
deductible. Once your adjuster has conﬁrmed your coverage, you may have your
vehicle repaired at the autobody shop of your choice.

You’re at fault for the collision – As the at-fault driver you’re responsible for your full
deductible. Your licence plate insurance will also pay the other driver’s deductible and
cover any damage to their vehicle.

 2     Saskatchewan’s driver’s licence program
      2.2 Vehicle Registration



    Shared responsibility for the collision – When two motorists are each found partially
    responsible for a collision, both drivers pay a portion of their deductible if their vehicle
    is damaged. For example, if you’re found 25% responsible for a collision you pay 25%
    of your deductible.

    Personal Auto Injury Insurance
    The Personal Auto Injury Insurance program provides coverage for Saskatchewan
    residents injured in automobile collisions anywhere in Canada or the United States.
    Coverage provided depends on which of two auto injury products you choose – No
    Fault Coverage or Tort Coverage.

    Extended Auto Insurance
    Basic plate insurance allows you to drive with minimal coverage, but to protect
    yourself, your family, your passengers, and your vehicle, you may ﬁnd you’ll need more
    than just the basics. A licensed insurance broker or agent will explain your options
    and provide advice on economical ways to obtain the protection you need.

    Extended auto insurance can cover your vehicle for replacement cost, pay for the
    cost of a rental if your vehicle is damaged, reduce the deductible you pay for damage
    to your vehicle and top-up your injury coverage. Most importantly, it increases your
    liability from the minimum $200,000.

    Despite your efforts to be a good driver, a moment of distraction, tiredness,
    inexperience, poor road conditions and many other things can result in major
    collisions. You can be sued and held responsible for damages if you’re at fault — even
    if you have No Fault injury coverage. If you don’t have enough insurance or the means
    to pay for your defence or the damages caused, you may be expected to pay
    a portion of your earnings for many years as a result of lacking enough coverage.

2.3 Graduated Driver Licensing Program
What is Graduated Driver Licensing?
Graduated Driver Licensing (GDL) is a program designed to improve road safety
by exposing new drivers to incremental levels of risk as they gain more driving
experience. New drivers, regardless of age, are provided with the support, skills and
experience they need as they work towards becoming fully qualiﬁed drivers.

There are three stages to Saskatchewan’s Graduated Driver Licensing program –
Learner, Novice 1 and Novice 2. As drivers pass through these stages, they will see
fewer restrictions at each stage until they graduate to an experienced Class 5 driver’s
licence. The Learner, Novice 1 or Novice 2 driving status is indicated on the driver’s
licence.

Steps in the Graduated Driver Licensing program
1. Obtain a Learner’s licence.
2. Practise driving for nine months with a supervising driver.
3. Complete the required mandatory driver training education with a
   certiﬁed instructor.
4. Pass a road test.
5. Practise driving as a Class 5 Novice 1 driver for six months.
6. Drive as a Class 5 Novice 2 driver for 12 months with no incidents (e.g., at-fault
   collision, trafﬁc conviction* and suspension free).
   In the event of an incident, the Novice 2 driver will be required to restart
   the 12-month incident-free period again from the loss date/conviction date.
   Interruptions such as licence suspensions, refusal to issue or non-renewal will
   extend the 12 months for any period of time the driver did not hold a valid licence.
7. Graduate to an experienced Class 5 driver’s licence.
* Where found to be at fault for a collision or convicted of a trafﬁc offence the 12-month period will restart
  from the loss date or conviction date respectively.

Graduated Driver Licensing Improvement program
Drivers in any stage who are found at fault for a collision, or who receive convictions
or suspensions, will be placed in the Graduated Driver Licensing Improvement
program. Drivers will progress through the following steps:
• A warning letter will be sent to the driver if the ﬁrst trafﬁc incident (conviction) has an
  assigned rating of two points or fewer.*
• If the ﬁrst trafﬁc incident (conviction, at-fault collision, suspension) has an assigned
  rating of three to six points, the driver will be required to attend a Trafﬁc Safety
  Education session.

Each incident thereafter will result in the driver being required to attend further
education courses followed by the administrative suspensions:
• Defensive Driving course
• Driver Improvement training – educates drivers on the responsibilities and
  consequences associated with driving and encourages safe driving habits
• 30-day driver’s licence suspension
• 90-day driver’s licence suspension
• 180-day driver’s licence suspension
• interview and further action
* For a complete list of offence and driver points, visit our website or call 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744).

Appeals
Drivers can appeal all sanctions, with the exception of the warning letter, Trafﬁc
Safety Education session, interview request and manual review to the Highway Trafﬁc
Board. The board is independent from SGI and has the authority to uphold, alter the
decision, issue a restricted licence and reduce or increase the length of any driver’s
licence suspension.


2.4 Change of name or address
If you change your name and/or address, you must tell SGI within 15 days by writing
to us, or at your motor licence issuer’s ofﬁce. Any changes to name and/or date of
birth must be also accompanied by a legal document supporting the change.

You can revise your contact information and change your mailing address, physical
address or email address through MySGI at www.mysgi.ca.

You can also notify SGI of your change of address through the ExpressAddress
online service at www.expressaddress.com. This service can also notify several other
provincial and municipal government organizations of your address change at the
same time.

The holder of a Class 7 licence must be supervised. The driving supervisor must:
• at all times, be capable of assuming operation of the vehicle;
• hold the equivalent of a Class 5 or greater driver’s licence issued by a Canadian or
  U.S. jurisdiction;

 snowmobile operators born after Jan. 1, 1989, must have taken an approved safety course in addition
 to holding a Class 1 to 5 driver’s licence. The holder of a Class 7 driver’s licence is permitted to operate
 an ATV or snowmobile provided they are accompanied by someone who holds a Class 1 to 5 driver’s
 licence or supervised (within 5 m of and in view of) by someone on another machine that holds a Class

      2.6 Medical requirements • 2.7 Operating in the United States • 2.8 Mandatory driver education



    2.6 Medical requirements
    When you apply for, or renew, your driver’s licence, any medical condition that may
    affect your ability to drive must be reported to SGI. Write this information on a
    supplementary medical application, available from all licence issuers. Failure to report
    medical conditions could result in a loss of insurance coverage. For more information
    contact SGI’s Customer Service Centre at 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744).

    Individuals applying for a Class 1, 2, 3 or 4 driver’s licence, or a Class 5 licence with
    a 1, 2, 3, 4, Heavy Trailer or School Bus Endorsement are required to meet medical
    standards and ﬁle a medical report with SGI before testing begins.


    2.7 Operating in the United States
    The United States and Canada have a reciprocity agreement, which recognizes a
    Canadian-issued commercial driver’s licence as proof of medical ﬁtness. However, in
    the United States, the operator of a Class 5 vehicle must have a commercial medical,
    if the vehicle or vehicle combination weighs or has a rated capacity (Gross Vehicle
    Weight Rating) over 4,536 kg.

    The United States commercial medical requirements also apply to farm-use vehicles
    registered in Class F, but do not apply to private-use vehicles (e.g., when vacationing
    in the United States towing a recreational vehicle).

    For more information please refer to the Saskatchewan Professional Driver’s Handbook.


    2.8 Mandatory driver education
    If you have a Class 7 licence you’re not eligible for a higher class of driver’s licence
    unless you’ve completed the High School Driver Education Program or received a
    minimum of six hours of in-car and six hours of in-class instruction from an
    SGI-certiﬁed driving instructor. Be sure to attend the parent information night
    sponsored by your high school educator. When hiring a driving instructor, ask to see
    their instructor certiﬁcation card to ensure it’s valid. You can ﬁnd a list of certiﬁed
    driving instructors at www.sgi.sk.ca/drivereducator.
    The driver instructor will either add your training record to your electronic SGI
    customer ﬁle or issue a Driver Education Certiﬁcate. If there isn’t a training record on
    your SGI customer ﬁle, you must present the Driver Education Certiﬁcate to the driver
    examiner at the time of your Class 5 road test(s).
    If you’re enrolled in the High School Driver Education Program, you’ll need to set up a
    free MySGI account to write your exam online. Any SGI motor licence issuer can set
    you up with an account. You’ll need to present your ID to complete this transaction.
    If you’re 15 years of age and registered in a certiﬁed High School Driver Education
    Program but have been placed on a waiting list, you’re still eligible to write the class
    7 licence exam. In order to write the exam you must present a copy of the Signature/
    Guarantor Form conﬁrming you are enrolled or intend to be enrolled in a driver
    education program. The Signature/Guarantor Form is available either at your high
    school or on the SGI website at sgi.sk.ca/new-drivers.

2.9 Preparing for your road test
Get plenty of practice under a variety of driving conditions. Be sure to practise exactly
the way your instructor taught you. Keep a record of your practice using the Practice
Log available from your driver educator or SGI. Learner driver signs and A Guide for
Supervisors of New Drivers – Co-Pilot’s Manual booklet are available free of charge
from SGI.

Road tests are conducted in English. Examiners use simple and clear language when
providing directions. To prepare for the road test, drivers should be familiar with the
following terms — right turn, left turn, lane change, trafﬁc lights, intersection, stop,
shoulder check and two-point turn.


2.10 Before the examination
Once you feel conﬁdent enough to take a driver examination, you can book your
appointment. Call or visit a motor licence issuer or book online with MySGI for
Class 5 road tests, motorcycle road tests and all written appointments. If you provide
your cellphone number while booking, you’ll get text messages to conﬁrm your
appointment, along with reminders before your appointment (24 hours and one hour
before). You can also check-in by text when you arrive for your road test. For all other
driver examination appointments call 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744). If you
don’t cancel your appointment and fail to show up, you’ll be required to pay for your
re-scheduled appointment.

Ofﬁce hours are 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Friday, and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday
in Regina and Saskatoon. Written tests are available in Regina and Saskatoon without
an appointment and are conducted from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday to Saturday.

You’re required to show proof of age by a birth certiﬁcate, passport or any document
acceptable to SGI. If you’re a ﬁrst-time driver between the ages of 15 and 18,
you must provide a completed Signature/Guarantor Form For First Time Drivers
providing consent that you may obtain driving privileges. Be sure to take several
pieces of original identiﬁcation with you. Photocopies of these documents are not
acceptable. If your name has changed due to marriage or other reasons, please bring
documentation that supports the name change.


2.11 Your test
For all classes of licence you are required to pass three types of tests including
knowledge tests, a vision test and a road test. Some classes of licence also require a
medical examination and pre-trip inspection.

Knowledge tests
The knowledge tests consist of two parts: driving situations, as well as the rules of
the road, and sign identiﬁcation. If you fail any part of these tests, you’ll be required
to rewrite only the examination(s) you failed. Successful written exam results are valid
for one year. You may write only once per day. If you’re unsure about the meaning of
any of the questions, please ask the examiner to assist you. The use of cellphones or
electronic devices is not allowed in the test area.

      2.11 Your test



    You can ﬁnd practice test questions as well as helpful animations in the online version
    of this handbook at www.sgi.sk.ca/quiz.

    Vision test
    The vision test may include:
    • a ﬁeld of vision test
    • a visual acuity test
    • distance judgment




    There are certain minimum vision standards you must meet. If you fail to meet those
    standards, you may be referred to an ophthalmologist or optometrist for further
    testing, and possible prescription of glasses or contact lenses. If you can pass the
    eye test only when you are wearing your glasses or contact lenses, you will be issued
    a restricted licence. This means your driver’s licence will be valid only when you are
    wearing prescribed corrective lenses.

    Learning period
    The holder of a Class 7 licence must retain that classiﬁcation for at least nine months
    before becoming eligible for any examinations toward obtaining a licence in any other
    class.

    Road test
    You’re required to take a road test in the appropriate class of vehicle and you must
    supply the vehicle. If there isn’t a training record on your SGI customer ﬁle, you must
    present your Driver Education Certiﬁcate to the driver examiner at the time of your
    road test.

    You must schedule your appointment at your nearest examination ofﬁce. Road test
    appointments in smaller centres are reserved for local residents only.

    Depending on your location, your examiner may use a paper and a clipboard or a
    digital app on a tablet to score your driving during the road test.

    The road test is an evaluation of your ability to safely operate a vehicle. You’ll be

When you arrive to your road test, please:
• park and turn off your vehicle;
• stay in your vehicle and text “Here” if you signed up for text notiﬁcations;
• make sure your cellphone and ringer/vibrate are on; and
• have your photo ID ready.

Your examiner will call you at your appointment time to ask some questions and then
will come out to meet you. To keep everyone safe, your supervising driver should wait
in our waiting room, rather than in our high-trafﬁc parking lot, while you take your road
test.

If you have any questions about the test, the examiner will be happy to answer them
for you before the test starts.

Note: No pets or passengers, other than examination staff, are permitted in your
vehicle during the road test.

A road test will be rescheduled if:
• you cannot provide proof of having completed the required driver education (training
  record on your electronic SGI ﬁle or Driver Education Certiﬁcate)
• you’re late for your appointment
• you don’t have the appropriate driver’s licence or have not paid the exam fee
• you haven’t held a Class 7 licence for at least nine months
• you don’t meet the vision or medical ﬁtness standards
• the vehicle you provide for the road test is unsafe or not equipped in accordance
  with the law. The Driver Examiner will inspect the vehicle before the test begins. The
  following list of equipment must be in working order, or the test can be rescheduled:

      2.11 Your test



    If your windshield is cracked and you’re unsure if it will be accepted for a road test,
    it’s best to have a driver examiner check it before your road test. Visit your local
    driver examination ofﬁce to have an examiner look at it in person. You can also visit
    sgi.sk.ca/windshield to ﬁnd examples of an acceptable windshield.

    You will fail the road test if you:
    • exceed the speed limit
    • are involved in a collision for which you are 50% or more responsible
    • fail to stop where required
    • fail to yield to vehicles and pedestrians
    • fail to wear a seatbelt
    • disobey trafﬁc lights
    • fail to follow a request from the examiner
    • require the assistance of the examiner
    • make a combination of minor mistakes

    At the end of the road test, a complete report will be given to you with all errors
    explained. If you were unsuccessful, the report will indicate where improvement is
    required. Depending on how the examiner scored your test, you’ll either get a paper
    copy of your results or have them emailed to you. The emailed results include links to
    the online Driver’s Handbook so you can follow up on the areas you need to work on.
    When you have had more practice, you may make an appointment for another road
    test. You must pay an additional test fee before each road test.

    If you’re applying for a Class 5 licence and fail your road test, you must wait two
    weeks before you are eligible for another road test. Additional training may be
    recommended or a longer learning period imposed. Successful exam results are valid
    for 12 months but your licence must be upgraded at any SGI motor licence issuer
    before you can drive alone.

3. Basic information and rules of the road
The six basic driving conditions
Driver condition
Driver condition refers to your physical, mental and emotional ﬁtness to drive. It’s
the most important of the six conditions, because a driver in top physical, mental
and emotional shape can adjust to all the other conditions and to the errors of other
drivers as well.

Vehicle condition
Vehicle condition affects your ability to control your vehicle, your ability to see and be
seen, and to communicate with other drivers and pedestrians. Your chances of staying
out of a collision are better with a vehicle in tip-top condition than they are with one
that has operational defects. You are the only one who knows when something isn’t
working right. Only you can spot possible vehicle defects and either repair them or
get them corrected by a qualiﬁed mechanic.

Light condition
The ﬁrst requirement of safe driving is to see and be seen. This ability is affected by
light condition. The presence of natural or artiﬁcial light; you can have too little light, or
too much light. The hazard of too little light is found in the fact that the nighttime fatal
collision rate is more than double the daytime rate.

Weather condition
Bad weather can affect traction, visibility and vehicle control. Rain, snow and ice make
road surfaces slippery. Adverse weather can obscure your vision with rain, snow,
fog or road splatter, as well, steam up glass with interior vapour. Other drivers ﬁnd
it harder to see you, and pedestrians hide behind umbrellas so they fail to see cars
approaching. High winds make steering difﬁcult and cause vehicles to veer to the
wrong side of the road.

Road condition
Road condition refers to the total roadway and the type and condition of the road
surface. These can affect your ability to steer, stop and manoeuver. Adverse road
conditions can be produced by weather. Conditions change from one kind of road
to another – from a side street to a thoroughfare, from a secondary road to a main
highway, from a two-lane road to an expressway. Any trip may involve a number of
different road conditions, each requiring an adjustment in your driving.

 3     Basic information and rules of the road
      3.1 Speeding, stunting and racing



    Trafﬁc condition
    Trafﬁc conditions are created by the number of vehicles and pedestrians using the
    same road or street at the same time you are, and to a large extent by how well the
    road has been engineered to accommodate the amount of trafﬁc present at a given
    time. More cars mean more conﬂict in trafﬁc and more chance for a collision. Trafﬁc
    conditions are inﬂuenced by the time of day, day of the week, even time of year in the
    case of holiday periods, and by the nature of the environment, such as a shopping
    centre, sports arena, factory or school.


    3.1 Speeding, stunting and racing
    There are speed limits on all Saskatchewan roads, streets and highways. Always
    drive your vehicle within the posted speed limit. Emergency vehicles responding to an
    emergency may exceed the speed limit.
    On most provincial highways, and in urban areas, speed limit signs are posted. In the
    absence of signs, the speed limit is 80 km/h. Most urban centres post speed limit
    signs at the entrances to the town or city. Those speed limits apply to all locations
    within community boundaries, unless otherwise posted. The speed limit means the
    fastest you can travel under ideal conditions.
    Stunting and racing can have serious and often life-threatening consequences.

    Some of the things that could land you a ticket, licence suspension and impoundment are:
    • racing side by side with another vehicle while disobeying the speed limit
    • chasing another vehicle
    • speeding in and out of lanes to unsafely pass vehicles
    • attempting to lift some or all tires from the roadway (including driving a motorcycle on
      one wheel)
    • attempting to spin a vehicle to cause it to spin or circle
    • driving a vehicle while not sitting in the driver’s seat
    • driving your vehicle in a way that prevents another vehicle from passing
    • stopping or slowing down to interfere with the movement of another vehicle

    The maximum speed limit when passing tow trucks or emergency vehicles that
    are stopped with their lights ﬂashing or when passing Ministry of Highways and
    Infrastructure equipment with lights ﬂashing, whether in motion or not, is 60 km/h.
    Within the work zone (road maintenance areas), motorists are required to slow down
    and travel no faster than the posted speed. Fines for speeding triple when passing
    highway workers or equipment occupied by a worker in the work zone. Some cities
    have bylaws requiring drivers to obey work zone speed limits through the entire
    construction area. Please be familiar with the bylaws in your area.
    Drivers are also required to reduce their speed to 60 km/h when passing a tow truck
    stopped on the roadside with its amber or amber and blue lights ﬂashing while it’s
    assisting to a disabled vehicle.
    In school zones drivers must be particularly careful. Each city or town sets speed
    limits in school zones through local bylaws. As a result, laws vary from place to place
    so watch for signs. If there are no signs, you should still reduce your speed and
    proceed cautiously in school zones.

3.2 Distracted driving
                                                                                              3
Police use photo radar to enforce speed limits in some work zones, school zones
and high-risk locations. Photo radar tickets are issued to the registered owner of the
speeding vehicle driven through the zone.
You must slow down when approaching animals on or near the road.
Regardless of the posted or basic speed limit you must never travel faster than
conditions allow for safe and reasonable passage. At the same time, travelling too
slowly can be hazardous. You should never drive at a speed slow enough to impede
or block other trafﬁc, unless proper safety precautions have been taken.


3.2 Distracted driving
Always drive with care, attention and reasonable consideration for other road users.
It’s illegal for you, or any of your passengers, to perform stunts or other activities that
distract, startle or interfere with other road users.

Driver inattention and distraction is responsible for 14% of all collisions. On average, it
leads to 19 fatalities a year in Saskatchewan (based on an average from 2019 – 2021).

Driving requires you to do more than two things at once – steering, braking, shifting
gears and watching for trafﬁc all occur at the same time. When you add distractions
like eating, grooming, talking or texting on cellphones, the results can be disastrous.
Drivers should devote their full attention to driving. Some of the most common driver
distractions include persons, objects or events outside the vehicle, distraction from
passengers, looking for or at something in the vehicle, adjusting radio, climate or
vehicle controls, smoking and eating or drinking.

You also shouldn’t distract other road users - deliberately creating loud and
unnecessary noise with a motor vehicle is not permitted.

Cellphones
Holding, viewing or manipulating a hand-held cellphone or mobile device is prohibited
in Saskatchewan. Experienced drivers, who are no longer in the GDL, can use hands-
free cellphones if they’re activated with voice commands or one-touch, and are
dashboard, visor or cradle mounted.

Note: Hands-free cellphone or mobile devices are prohibited for drivers in the GDL
program.

Hands-free use of cellphones while driving is allowed for experienced drivers*,
including:
• devices that clip to the visor
• headsets, either wired or wireless
• voice-activated devices
• devices built into the vehicle, such as OnStar or those with Bluetooth technology
• Bluetooth ear pieces

 3     Basic information and rules of the road
      3.3 Stopping and parking • 3.4 Sharing the road



    • one-touch activation of a speakerphone feature on a cellphone placed within easy
      reach
    • making 9-1-1 calls on cellphones while driving for both new and experienced drivers
    • making a call on a cellphone when parked on the side of the road, for both new and
      experienced drivers
    * Experienced drivers are drivers who are not in the GDL program.

    If you have a previous conviction (within a 12-month period) for using electronic
    communication devices while driving, or driving without reasonable care or
    consideration, and receive another ticket for either of these offences, it will result in
    the vehicle you’re driving to be impounded for seven days, regardless of who the
    vehicle owner is.


    3.3 Stopping and parking
    You must move as far to the right as possible when stopping on a road.

    When stopping on a rural road or highway you must be 30 m (98 ft.) away from any
    vehicle stopped on the opposite side of the road or highway.

    Vehicles stopped on rural roads or highways at night must be marked with ﬂares,
    hazard lights or reﬂectors. You must not tamper with the devices used to mark
    stopped vehicles.

    Always come to a complete stop at all stop signs and at railway crossings where
    signals or gates are activated. After stopping, only proceed from a stop sign, or a
    railway crossing without gates, when it’s safe to do so. You must also stop when
    signaled to by a police ofﬁcer or a ﬂagperson.

    If there are painted curbs or signs that prohibit parking please follow them and park
    somewhere else.

    Be considerate of others and your own safety. If you must stop in your lane (possibly
    due to heavy trafﬁc) always stop behind the crosswalk, before entering an intersection
    or before a railway crossing so you don’t obstruct pedestrians or other trafﬁc.


    3.4 Sharing the road
    You have to share the road with people who drive a variety of vehicles. The more
    you know about the particular driving requirements of different vehicles, the better
    equipped you’ll be to share the road and predict the actions of other drivers.

    Sharing the road with large trucks
    The large truck is a special vehicle. Its motor is not
    much larger than a large car engine and yet the load
    it carries can be 50 or more times the weight of a car.
    When accelerating up to speed, truck drivers use up
    to 18 gear changes. Once they get into top gear, they
    do not appreciate having to start again. Therefore,
    avoid forcing a truck driver to slow down.

Large trucks will decrease speed when going uphill. You can expect truck drivers to
pick up speed when going down hills to help them get up the other side. Plan your
passing manoeuvre accordingly.

It takes longer to stop a large truck than a car, so a truck driver needs a longer
following distance to be safe and in control. Don’t cut in front of a large truck
immediately after you have passed it.

Truck drivers have problems seeing smaller vehicles. Although they have mirrors
that help them to see each side, you may not be visible to the driver if you follow
too closely. (Besides, you can’t see anything yourself.) Realize that in poor weather,
exterior mirrors become spotted with rain and dirt and the truck driver doesn’t have an
interior mirror. Be sure to make yourself visible. Drive with your headlights on.

The driver of a large truck or bus has difﬁculty turning sharp corners, particularly to
the right. If the driver follows the proper procedure, vehicles facing them on the street
they are entering should be prepared for the large truck or bus to enter their half of
the roadway. If the large truck operator is not following the proper procedure, vehicles
on their right in the street they are leaving should stay well back to avoid being
crushed between the large truck and the curb. When you see a large truck or bus
making a sharp right turn, give it the room it needs.

All drivers should avoid a large truck’s “no-zone.” The no-zone refers to the blindspot
areas around big trucks, where crashes are most likely to occur. Just like cars, large
trucks have blindspots on both sides, but a large truck’s are considerably bigger.
These blindspots can mean trouble if a trucker decides to change lanes and a car is in
the blindspot. In addition to the blindspots on the sides of a large truck, drivers should
be careful around the front end of large trucks.

Truckers sit up high and the hood of the cab obscures part of the road ahead. This is
why when drivers in a car are passing a large truck, they should make sure they can
see the entire truck cab in their rear-view mirror before pulling in front. If a car cuts
in too soon, truck drivers are forced to react with little time or room to spare. Large
trucks also have deep rear blindspots. A good rule of thumb is that if you can’t see the
large truck’s mirrors, the truck driver can’t see you.

    Sharing the road with snow plows
    • Slow down – STAY BACK and STAY ALIVE when you
      approach the mini blizzard created by a snow plow.
    • Every winter, snow plows are hit by motorists who don’t
      see them or see them too late. The vast majority of these
      incidents are rear-end collisions where motorists have
      failed to adjust to changing road and weather conditions.
    • Snow plow operators are working in difﬁcult weather conditions on the highways to
      clear snow and ice and make the roads safer for all motorists.
    • Drivers must slow to 60 km/h when passing snow plows or other highway
      equipment that are stopped on the highway with blue and amber warning lights
      ﬂashing.
    • Snow plows that are in motion, can be passed on the highway if it’s safe to do so.
      Drivers in this case are not limited to travelling 60 km/h.
    • Snow plows must travel slower than average trafﬁc when clearing snow and
      spreading salt and sand. Be patient and proceed with caution.
    • Ministry of Highways crews clear major highways within six hours of the end of the
      storm to make winter driving safe. Please give them room to work safely.

    Sharing the road with snowmobiles, ATVs
    and golf carts
    If snowmobiles and ATVs were always operated
    according to the law, there would be little chance of
    conﬂict with other vehicles on the streets and highways.
    Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case.

    Snowmobiles are difﬁcult to see because they are small
    and low. These features, accompanied by exposure
    to weather, also make it difﬁcult for the snowmobile
    operator to see. As snowmobiles are useful in storms,
    they’re likely to be out when visibility is poor.

    Also, children with little road experience operate snowmobiles and ATVs. When you
    see a snowmobile or ATV, anticipate that it may cross the road suddenly or go out of
    control, and decide how you will react.

    In some municipalities, local bylaws allow snowmobiles, ATVs and golf carts to be
    operated on the street.

Sharing the road with emergency vehicles
All emergency vehicles (ﬁre engines, police vehicles
ambulances, and emergency vehicles that have been
designated by a municipality or the Highway Trafﬁc
Board to be used in response to an emergency) have
the right of way when displaying ﬂashing lights and
using sirens (sound devices).
• When approached by an emergency vehicle with
  its lights ﬂashing or sirens engaged, you must
  immediately drive as closely as possible to the
  right edge of the roadway and not enter the next
  intersection until the emergency vehicle has passed.
  The only exception is if a peace ofﬁcer gives you
  other directions. On one-way streets, pull right or left
  to the nearest curb.
• At an intersection, you must stop and let the emergency vehicle through the
  intersection, unless given other directions by a peace ofﬁcer.

If the emergency vehicle has its lights ﬂashing, but no siren engaged, motorists in the
vicinity should extend the same privilege as previously mentioned while meeting or
being overtaken by the emergency vehicle.

• When an emergency vehicle is stopped on the highway with its emergency lights in
  operation, you must slow down to 60 km/h when passing it. This doesn’t apply to
  vehicles travelling in the opposite direction on a divided highway. However, this does
  apply when travelling in the opposite direction on an undivided highway.
• Never attempt to follow an emergency vehicle going to, or coming from, an emergency.

Sharing the road with farm equipment and
overwidth vehicles
Saskatchewan’s agricultural base means that
farm equipment such as combines, tractors, large
cultivators, etc. may be on highways and grid roads
from early spring until late fall.

These vehicles create a hazard, as they travel very
slowly – 10 to 40 km/h. Therefore, you may come
upon them very quickly and you’ll need to stop or
change lanes rapidly. Watch for them on the road and
only pass them when it’s safe to do so.

      3.4 Sharing the road



    Sharing the road with school buses
    School bus drivers have a difﬁcult job. There are
    plenty of distractions inside the bus. Knowing this,
    you should make extra allowances, and be aware of
    the possibility that the bus driver may not see you or
    your signals. Rear-end collisions are the most frequent
    type of crash involving school buses and are usually
    caused by another driver failing to stop while the bus
    is loading or unloading passengers.

    When approaching a school bus, if you see amber ﬂashing lights, slow down and
    proceed with caution. If the red ﬂashing lights are activated, you must come to a
    complete stop. If you’re approaching the bus from the opposite direction on an
    undivided highway, you must also stop. The single greatest threat to the safety of
    children who ride school buses is motorists who pass the bus when children are
    loading or unloading.

    When approaching a bus that has its stop arm out and its red ﬂashing lights activated,
    as a driver:
    • You must stop no closer than 5 m (15 ft.) from the front or back of the bus.
    • You must not advance your vehicle until the bus driver turns off the ﬂashing red stop
      lamps and deactivates the stop arm.
    • Before moving, check to see that all children have safely crossed the roadway.

    Passing a school bus with red ﬂashing lights is a serious offence and will result in
    a minimum ﬁne of $360. You don’t have to stop for a school bus if you’re travelling
    in the opposite direction on a divided highway. Some cities, towns and villages may
    have a bylaw prohibiting the use of ﬂashing red stop lamps and stop arms on school
    buses. In those communities you’re allowed to pass the bus. Drivers aren’t required to
    stop for buses displaying four-way hazard lamps; however, use caution, go slowly and
    always watch for children crossing.

    Sharing the road with motorcycles
    When a motorcycle and a four-wheel vehicle collide,
    the motorcyclist is at a high risk for being killed or
    severely injured. Since motorcycles are more agile
    than cars, their actions are more difﬁcult to predict and
    their size makes them hard to see.

    Most motorcycles are wired so that their headlights
    are on at all times, making it easier for you to see
    them. Be alert for motorcycles that don’t have their
    headlights on. During motorcycle season, check twice
    before making a lane change or turn – once for cars
    and trucks, and once for motorcycles and bikes.

    When passing a motorcycle, ensure you leave adequate distance ahead of the
    motorcycle before you pull back in to the lane. Failure to leave sufﬁcient room can be
    extremely dangerous for the motorcyclist.

The same three-second following distance should be given to motorcycles as is given
to other vehicles. Following too closely may cause a motorcycle rider’s attention to be
distracted from the road and trafﬁc ahead.

Motorcyclists are allowed to ride two abreast but most riders prefer to have a full
lane width. A skilled motorcyclist is constantly changing positions within a lane to
increase his ability to see and be seen, and to avoid objects on the road. Never move
into the same lane beside a motorcycle, even if the lane is wide and the motorcyclist
is riding to one side. It is not only illegal, it’s extremely hazardous. When overtaking a
motorcycle or bicycle in your lane, you must pass in the same manner as you would
pass a car.

Bad weather and slippery surfaces cause greater problems for motorcycles than for
cars. Allow more following distance for motorcycles when the road surface is wet and
slippery. These conditions create stability problems.

Being aware of these situations can help you share the road safely with all cyclists.

New motorcyclists are required to display a
Motorcycle Graduated Driver Licensing (MGDL)
placard on their licence plate identifying them
as new riders. Learners are required to display
a red ‘L’ placard and Novice riders must display
green ‘N’ placards. Please use caution when
passing or following a new rider and give them
plenty of space.


Sharing the road with bicycles
Bicycles are vehicles too and entitled to their
share of the road. More people are using them for
transportation, recreation, physical ﬁtness, and to
reduce emissions. Cyclists must obey the same rules
of the road as other vehicles.

Cyclists travelling at a lower speed than other trafﬁc
are expected to ride about one metre from the curb or
parked cars, or as close as practical to the right-hand
edge of the road when there is no curb.
• Cyclists are not required to ride close to the right edge of the road when they are
  travelling at or faster than the normal speed of trafﬁc at that time and place, or when
  they are turning left, or getting in position to turn left.
Bike lanes are reserved for cyclists. Sometimes you will need to enter or cross a bike
lane to turn right at a corner or driveway. Take extra care when you do this. Enter the
bike lane only after ensuring that you can do so safely, and then make the turn.

      3.4 Sharing the road



    When you’re sharing the road with cyclists please remember:
    • Many children riding bicycles on the street are very young and lack the necessary
      training and skills for safe cycling.
    • When passing or overtaking a cyclist, go around them like you would any other
      vehicle.
    • Watch for cyclists’ hand signals. A cyclist may indicate a right-hand turn by extending
      their right arm. If possible, try to make eye contact with cyclists.
    • When turning left, you must stop and wait for oncoming bicycles to pass before
      turning.
    • When driving through an intersection, be careful to scan for cyclists waiting to turn
      left.
    • When you’re preparing to make a right turn, watch for cyclists who may pull up
      alongside your vehicle. Check your blind spots.
    • When making a right turn, do not pull up beside a cyclist and then turn directly in front
      of them and cut them off.
    • When pulling away from the curb always check for cyclists who may be travelling near
      the right edge of the lane or curb.
    • When parked at the curb, always check for cyclists when you open your vehicle door.
    • Give cyclists space with a safe following distance. They do not have brake lights to
      warn you when they’re slowing or stopping.
    • Cyclists are entitled to make left turns the same way as motorists. Since they
      are exposed on left turns, they will need extra consideration, especially on
      multi-lane roads.
    • It’s easy to misjudge the speed of bicycles — they can travel faster than you think!
      Experienced cyclists can travel at 25-35 km/h on a ﬂat surface and up to 50km/h
      going downhill.
    • Cyclists are entitled to ride at least one metre from the curb and may ride even further
      out when they steer away from drainage grates, potholes, debris, loose gravel or sand,
      wet or slippery surfaces, rutted or grooved pavement and even dogs. Be aware of the
      roadway conditions that may affect a cyclist.
    • Don’t use your horn when you’re passing a cyclist. It may frighten them and cause
      them to steer into your path. If you feel that you must use your horn, tap it quickly and
      lightly while you are still some distance away from the cyclist.
    There’s also a class of bicycle called power-assisted bicycles, commonly known as
    e-bikes or electric bicycles and many are designed to look like scooters equipped
    with pedals. These types of vehicles use an electric motor to help the operator up to a
    maximum speed of 32 km/h. Treat them the same way you would any other cyclist.

Sharing the road with e-scooters
(electric kick scooters)
E-scooters (also known as electric kick scooters or
electric scooters) are known as limited speed motor
vehicles and are permitted in communities, towns, or
cities that have speciﬁc e-scooter bylaws in place. To
see if they’re legal in your community, please reach out
to your municipality directly.
E-scooters don’t need to be registered and don’t require a driver’s licence, but users
must be at least 16 years old, wear an approved helmet, follow all municipal laws and
provincial regulations and legislation.

If e-scooters are allowed on public roads in a community, motor vehicle drivers and
other road users must learn to share the road with e-scooters. It’s important to know
the rules within each community that you drive in. For more information on e-scooters,
please visit www.sgi.sk.ca/e-scooters or call our Customer Service Centre at
1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744).

Sharing the road with tow trucks
and vehicles rendering assistance
on the roadside
When a vehicle used exclusively for towing or
rendering assistance is stopped on a roadside with
its amber or amber and blue lights ﬂashing to help a
disabled vehicle, drivers must slow to 60 km/h when
passing. This does not apply to vehicles travelling in
the opposite direction on a divided highway. However,
this does apply when travelling in the opposite
direction on an undivided highway.

Sharing the road with funeral processions
Funeral processions have special privileges and
should not be interfered with or interrupted. They
must, however, obey all trafﬁc signs and signals –
unless all drivers with the right of way stop to permit
the procession to proceed.

      3.5 The concept of gates



    3.5 The concept of gates
    The concept of “gates” is introduced to
    help you understand how to deal with
    vehicles around you.

    Imagine four gates surround your
    vehicle at all times. One gate is located
    in front of the vehicle, one is behind and
    one is on each side of the vehicle.

    When you’re travelling alone in the centre lane of a road where there are three lanes
    provided in the direction you’re travelling, all four gates are open to you. This means
    you can move ahead, slow down and drop back, or move to your right or left, and still
    continue uninterrupted movement.




    If a gate is open you can drive into it whenever you want to. A safe driver always tries
    to have at least two open gates to provide options for emergency movement.




    If a gate is closed – by another vehicle, a curb, a guardrail or even deep snow – you
    lose the opportunity to move into the area that gate controls.

3.5 The concept of gates • 3.6 Blind spots
                                                                                             3
Check your mirrors to ensure you know which gates are open. You need to check
your inside mirror and your left outside mirror often. When you’re a more experienced
driver, start using your right mirror, if you have one.

While you aren’t required to identify a vehicle in detail, you should know whether the
rear gate is open so that you could drop back if you wished.

If the vehicle behind you is tailgating, then your rear gate is closed. You need to
leave extra following distance ahead to allow room if you have to stop. Increase your
following distance to ﬁve or six seconds (see “Using time to estimate your following
distance,” page 87).

How often you check your mirrors depends upon the number of lanes and the amount
of trafﬁc. If you’ve ever been surprised by a vehicle overtaking you, then you’re not
looking in your mirrors often enough.


3.6 Blind spots
A “blind spot” is an area alongside your vehicle that
you can’t see when using any of your mirrors. It’s                BLIND SPOT
important to check these blind spots to ensure your
side gates are open, particularly if you’re going to
change lanes.

A quick glance over your shoulder, or “shoulder
check,” can allow you to see the entire side gate area            BLIND SPOT
of your vehicle, which could be a blind spot.
Shoulder check your blind spot for the gate you’re driving into. For the left side, turn
your head left until you are looking along your shoulder. You’re checking to see if there
is a vehicle closing your gate. If there is something there, don’t try to move into that
space. To check the right side, you need to turn your head to the right.

Watch out for motorcyclists and bicyclists, especially during low light conditions (dusk
and dawn) or during periods of inclement weather, as these vehicles are small, fast
and very manoeuvrable and may be easy to miss during a shoulder check.




For your own safety and the safety of other motorists, don’t drive in other drivers’ blind
spots. Move forward, or drop back, as soon as you notice this situation.

The blind spot can be signiﬁcantly reduced if your mirrors are properly adjusted (see
page 103).

      3.7 Directional dividing lines



    3.7 Directional dividing lines
    Yellow directional dividing lines separate
    trafﬁc travelling in opposite directions.

    White line markings are used to separate
    trafﬁc travelling in the same direction.

    Freeway lanes, as well as some city street
    lanes, which are ending will usually be
    marked by double wide lines painted on
    the pavement. If you’re driving in a lane
    marked with double wide lines, be
    prepared for the lane to end. You’ll have to
    exit the freeway, turn at the next intersection,
    or merge. Look for signs.




    Vehicle A may pass if the road is clear ahead and behind.




    Vehicle A must not pass or make a left turn between intersections.

3.8 Trafﬁc lanes
On roads with marked lanes, you must travel entirely in one lane. Where there are no
lane lines marked, you should travel as if there were markings there. Changing lanes is
permitted only when safe to do so.

Where a solid line separates lanes, you may not move across the solid line. The only
exceptions are double lines in the centre of a highway where the line nearest you is a
broken line (see the preceding illustrations) or centre turning lanes (see page 46).


3.9 Lane position
On highways or rural roads, keep to the right of your lane.

In urban areas, you’ll usually drive in the middle of the lane. However, your position in
the lane should allow you to see as much as possible.

Your lane position provides information to other drivers. If you intend to turn left, move
to the left side of the lane. If you’re going to turn right, move to the right side of the
lane, but be careful to leave enough room for passing parked vehicles.

At some intersections, signs or trafﬁc lights indicate two or more lanes may be used
to complete a turn. At these locations, you must approach the intersection and
complete the turn in the same relative lane position.




3.10 Lane selection
Choose the driving lane that gives you the best vision and allows you to keep the
maximum number of gates open.

• On slippery surfaces, pick the part of the lane that offers the most traction.
• When turning at intersections, choose the lane that the law says you must take (see
  “Turning,” page 41). On a divided highway use the left lane to approach a left turn
  off the highway.
• On a multi-lane divided highway the left lane is intended for vehicles to pass slower
  moving right lane vehicles or for emergency vehicles. The maximum speed posted
  is the maximum under ideal road conditions. See page 117 for safe merging on a
  freeway.

      3.10 Lane selection • 3.11 Signalling



    It’s not a good practice to drive on the shoulder portion of the road. The area of the
    roadway to the right of the solid white line is designed for stopped vehicles. As well,
    the shoulder can be used for emergency manoeuvres, or preparing to make a right
    turn from a highway. The shoulder is not an extra driving lane. Some highways have
    rumble strips on the shoulder, and in some cases on the centre line, to alert drivers
    when they drift out of their lane.


    3.11 Signalling
    You must turn on your signal lights in advance of your turn or lane change. A good
    rule when driving at speeds under 60 km/h is to signal at least 30 m before turning.
    At higher speeds, signal at least 150 m from the corner.

    When changing lanes, you must signal and do mirror and shoulder checks before you
    begin to move out of your lane.

    If your signal lights or brake lights fail, these hand signals must be used.




    Left turn                       Right turn                   Stopping or slowing abruptly

    Turn signals
    When you use turn signals, you’re saying, “I intend to turn or change lanes.” If you
    wait until you’re actually turning or changing lanes before you signal, you’re not telling
    other drivers what you intend to do. They can already see that you’re turning.

    The procedure when you plan to turn or change lanes:
    1. Assuming that you know the status of your gates and are properly positioned for
       the turn, signal.
    2. Check your mirror.
    3. Shoulder check your blind spot for the gate you are moving into.
    4. Start the turn or lane change.
    5. Cancel signal once turn or lane change is complete.

    If you are approaching an intersection and want to change lanes, complete your lane
    change and cancel your signal before entering the intersection or wait until you pass
    through the intersection before turning on your signal and changing lanes. This helps
    to keep intersections safer and avoid confusion.

3.12 Changing lanes
The procedure for changing lanes:
1. Determine the need to change lanes well in advance. Make sure you know the
   conditions of your gate.
2. Signal your intention to change lanes.
3. Check your mirrors to see that the gate is open and that no one else is moving into it.
4. Shoulder check to look for vehicles or obstructions in your blind spot.
5. Look where you want the vehicle to go and steer there.
6. Accelerate gently and steer the vehicle to the position where you’re looking.
7. When you’re almost completely in the new lane, look ahead to the point where you
   intend to drive and your steering will adjust.
8. Cancel signal. Check the condition of your new gates. Adjust your speed.




When moving through more than a single lane, make the change as one continual
action. Only one signal is required, and don’t forget to shoulder check.


3.13 Passing
When meeting other vehicles, you must keep to the right of the centre line of the
roadway.

Head-on collisions are usually fatal. Driver distraction (e.g., texting/talking on a
cellphone, eating, etc.), driver impairment (fatigue, alcohol, drugs) or driver errors,
such as faulty judgment or techniques while passing, are often contributing factors in
these collisions..

When passing, it’s very important to keep the time spent on the wrong side of the
road to a bare minimum.

When passing:
1. Make sure the pass is legal, safe and necessary. Don’t cross solid or double solid
   yellow lines. Don’t pass on the crest of a hill, before a curve, at intersections or any
   place where your sight distance is limited.
2. Maintain a minimum three-second following distance between you and the vehicle
   you are following (see “Using time to estimate your following distance,”
   page 87). When you decide to pass, accelerate to build up speed before
   passing. The greater the difference in speed between you and the vehicle you’re
   passing, the shorter your passing time will be.

 3     Basic information and rules of the road
      3.13 Passing



    3. Continue to accelerate throughout the entire pass. Don’t slow down until you’re
       back in your original lane and well in front of the vehicle you just passed. Keep in
       mind that it’s illegal to speed even when passing.
    4. Wait until you see the vehicle being passed in your inside rear-view mirror before
       pulling back into your travelling lane. Remember, you must signal, check your
       mirrors and shoulder check to ensure it’s safe to re-enter your travelling lane.

    Note: At high speeds, the lane change is more gradual and takes longer to complete.

    When passing other vehicles, you must always pass on the left except:
    • where there are two or more trafﬁc lanes in your direction of travel
    • any time the vehicle ahead is about to make a left turn and it is possible to pass
      safely on the right without driving on the shoulder

    You may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an intersection to permit pedestrians to
    cross.

    When being passed on the left by another vehicle, stay to the right of your lane and
    maintain your speed. Don’t accelerate or obstruct the passing vehicle from returning
    to the right lane.

    Passing Lanes
    Passing lanes are designed to allow vehicles to pass safely and improve the ﬂow of
    trafﬁc. A passing lane is an additional lane added to a highway that permits a slower
    vehicle to move into the right hand lane, while a faster vehicle can pass safely in the
    left hand lane.

    The right hand lane is designated for travel and the left hand lane is only to be used
    for passing. Maintain your speed when moving into the right hand lane and do not
    speed up.

    Signs will alert you of a passing lane ahead. Have patience, maintain a safe following
    distance and wait for the passing lane instead of using the oncoming trafﬁc lane,
    which can be dangerous.

3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes
Major centres often have designated bus and/or bicycle lanes
that other motorists must stay out of unless they need to
enter them to turn, park or for entering a lane or driveway.

Bus lanes are marked by a lane sign that indicates the time
and days of operation of the restriction. The sign has a
diamond on it, as well as a bus symbol. In some centres, the
lane itself has diamond markings installed in the pavement.
On these designated streets, curb lanes are reserved for
transit vehicles during the rush hour, or peak driving times.
When bus lane hours are in effect, no one is allowed to operate a vehicle, other than
a bus or an emergency vehicle, in the designated curb lane, except for the purpose
of making a right turn onto, or off of, a street block where a bus lane is in effect.
Only buses, emergency vehicles or accessible taxicabs loading or unloading non-
ambulatory passengers are allowed to stop in a designated bus lane.




This sign indicates the
street you’re turning to has a
designated lane.

                                                                    Bicycle lane


Bicycle-only lanes are dedicated for cyclists and are similar to bus lanes. Vehicles
aren’t allowed in bicycle-only lanes except for the purpose of making a right turn,
accessing a parking space or entering a lane or driveway.

      Exclusive bicycle lanes                       Shared bicycle lanes




    Designated bicycle lanes may be exclusive for bicycle use (left) or shared with motor
    vehicle trafﬁc (right).

    Pavement marking may vary between communities.

    Shared bicycle lanes
    A chevron and bicycle symbol designate a shared bicycle or “sharrow” lane.

    Sharrows use pavement markings painted on a roadways to encourage cyclists and
    motorists to share the lane. They are generally intended for use on roadways with
    lanes that are wide enough for side-by-side bicycle and vehicle operation. However,
    motorists should always pass cyclists at a safe distance and should not assume that
    the sharrow indicates that they can pass within the travel lane. Depending on the
    positioning of the cyclist, it may be necessary to change lanes in order to pass safely.

    Sharrows do not designate a bicycle lane and should not be treated as such. While
    some cyclists will ride down the centre of the arrow, in many locations, the sharrow
    marking simply indicates cyclists and motorists are to share the lane and isn’t an
    indication of where a cyclist rides within the lane.

Right turns
When approaching an intersection or driveway that requires a right-hand turn, move
as close to the right curb or right edge of the road as possible.

General procedure:
1. Plan your right turn well in advance. Signal, check your rear gate and check your
   blind spot. When safe, move as close to the right as possible.
2. Check for trafﬁc, pedestrians and other real or potential hazards in or near the
   intersection. A basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping pattern will be
   sufﬁcient.
3. Slow down (shift to a lower gear if driving a manual transmission vehicle). Maintain
   a suitable speed throughout the turn to allow for proper vehicle control and avoid
   obstructing trafﬁc.
4. Check again for real or potential hazards.
5. If there are no real or potential hazards, complete your right turn into the ﬁrst
   available driving lane.

See page 79 for rules regarding turning right on a red light.

Left turns
Left turns are more dangerous than right turns because you have to cross trafﬁc
coming from at least two directions. This means that your searching pattern is very
important and you should continue to search as you cross the intersection. When
you intend to turn left across the path of any vehicle approaching from the opposite
direction, you must yield the right of way to the oncoming vehicle. When making a left
turn, you must approach the intersection and complete the turn in the left-most lane
available for your direction of travel.

General procedure:
1. If a lane change is required, decide well in advance to make your left turn. Signal
   and check your rear gate and blind spot to see if there is a vehicle close to you.
   Move safely into the left side of the left lane.
2. Check for trafﬁc, pedestrians and any other real or potential hazards that may be
   in or near the intersection. Use the basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping
   pattern.
3. Slow down (and shift to a lower gear if you are driving a manual transmission
   vehicle).
4. Check again for real or potential hazards. Watch out for motorcycles when
   completing a left turn. Motorists failing to identify oncoming motorcycles when
   making a left turn is a signiﬁcant contributing factor in collisions involving
   motorcycles.
5. If you have to stop in the intersection to wait for oncoming trafﬁc, be sure to keep
   your vehicle parallel to the lane and your front wheels straight. That way if you’re hit
   from behind, you will not be pushed in the path of oncoming trafﬁc.
6. If there are no potential hazards, complete your left turn into the ﬁrst available
   driving lane.

For a left turn from a one-way street to a one-way street, start the turn from the left
edge of the roadway and complete the turn in the left-most driving lane.

When a vehicle is parked in a lane closest to the left curb and near the intersection,
the driver must move into that lane at the ﬁrst opportunity before turning.




For a left turn from a two-way street to a one-way street, turn from the lane next to the
centre line and enter the one-way street into the left-most driving lane.

      3.16 Centre turning lanes



    3.16 Centre turning lanes
    This sign indicates a two-way left turning lane. These are
    used in many communities, especially larger centres,
    to improve trafﬁc ﬂow and to allow for easier access to
    properties in mid-block.

    The diagram indicates the correct turning procedure. Here are
    some other points to keep in mind when using centre turning
    lanes:
    • Enter the two-way left turning
      lane only at the point adjacent
      to the property you want to
      access (see arrow for car A).
    • Left turns from either direction
      may be made from the two-way
      left turning lane.
    • When leaving a driveway or
      parking lot, pick a gap in trafﬁc,
      complete the turn by driving
      through the centre turning
                                            B
      lane and into the ﬁrst available
      driving lane as quickly as
      possible (see arrow for car B).
    • The centre turning lanes may
      not be used as a passing lane
      or as a driving lane.
    • Where a centre turning lane is
      provided, you may not make a
      left turn from any other lane.

Uncontrolled intersections
At an intersection where there are no stop signs, yield signs, trafﬁc lights or police
directing trafﬁc, and two vehicles arrive at the intersection at approximately the same
time, the driver of the vehicle on the left must yield the right of way to the driver of the
vehicle on the right.




This rule also applies to T-intersections.

    When turning left, you must yield the right of way to any vehicles coming toward you if
    they are close enough that your turn would interfere with them.




    When entering a provincial highway from any other road, you must yield the right of

When entering a street, road or highway from a private road, lane or alley, you must
yield the right of way to any pedestrians on the sidewalk and to any vehicles on the
street, road or highway.




Controlled intersections
At any intersection where a yield sign is present, drivers facing the sign must yield the
right of way to any other motorist approaching the intersection.

At three and four-way stops, courtesy dictates that the ﬁrst vehicle that stops should
be given the right of way. The remaining three then yield the right of way to the driver
on their right.

At two-way stops, vehicles must remain stopped until all cross trafﬁc passes. When
two vehicles arrive around the same time to the opposite stop signs and one of the
vehicles is turning left, the driver turning left must yield the right of way to the driver
going straight. If it’s safe, the vehicle turning left can go next, even if another vehicle
arrives in the meantime, and plans to go straight. The left turning vehicle can turn
left while the next vehicle advances to the stop line. This keeps trafﬁc ﬂowing. When
opposing vehicles are both going straight, the drivers can proceed at the same time.

In any case, if you’re at a stop sign you must yield to vehicles and pedestrians and
may not proceed until it’s safe.

All drivers have a moral and legal responsibility to avoid collisions. If you have the right
of way at an intersection and a driver refuses to yield to you, you’re responsible from
a safety standpoint to avoid a collision, rather than insist upon your right of way. Don’t
forget the old adage – “You could be right – dead right.”

      3.17 Right of way



    Construction or maintenance vehicles
    At all times, you must yield the right of way to any highway construction or
    maintenance vehicles that have their warning lights ﬂashing.

    Zipper merge
    When a lane is closed in a construction zone, you might need to make a zipper
    merge. A zipper merge means drivers use both lanes of trafﬁc until the lane ends,
    and then alternate in “zipper” fashion into the open lane. Vehicles in the lane that’s
    ending must signal, shoulder check and merge when safe, while each driver in the
    continuing lane should let one vehicle in. Sometimes both lanes are merging into
    a new lane and drivers in both lanes must signal, shoulder check and take turns
    merging when it’s safe.

    Zipper merging is beneﬁcial because it makes trafﬁc ﬂow more quickly and efﬁciently
    for drivers in both lanes. It also creates a sense of fairness and equity since all lanes
    are moving at the same rate. Zipper merging also helps reduce:
    • differences in speeds between two lanes
    • the overall length of trafﬁc backup
    • congestion on freeway interchanges




    Always pay attention and follow any posted signs you see in a construction area.
    Zipper merge signs may not always be present, but zipper merging is allowed and
    recommended in construction zones.

    Remember to be courteous, merge when safe and you’ll zip through quickly.

3.18 Stopping positions
There are several different situations you may see when preparing to stop at an
intersection with a stop sign or trafﬁc light. Where you should stop and your stopping
position, is determined by markings on the road. You must stop:




At the nearest crosswalk,      At a clearly marked        Where there is no stop line,
whether marked or not.         stop line.                 sidewalk or crosswalk:
                                                          • Within three metres of the

    Roundabouts
    In a roundabout, the vehicle on the right must yield to the vehicle on the left.

    In the diagram, trafﬁc indicated by red arrows in yellow lanes must yield to trafﬁc
    indicated by white arrows in green lanes. Trafﬁc entering the roundabout must yield to
    trafﬁc in the roundabout.

    In this diagram:
    • B and C must yield to A.
    • E must yield to D while F and D proceed.
    • H must yield to G.




    When you’re leaving the roundabout use your right-turn signal to warn other drivers of
    your intention to exit.

    It’s recommended that for safety, entry into the right lane be used mainly when
    intending to exit at the ﬁrst available exit point. If you are intending to proceed beyond
    the second exit, you should drive in the left lane.

Diverging Diamond Interchange
A diverging diamond interchange is new to Saskatchewan, but is gaining popularity
across North America. This type of interchange is designed to improve safety and
reduce delays by maintaining the ﬂow of trafﬁc. The key feature of this type of
interchange is that trafﬁc on the overpass crosses over to the opposite side of the
road at one trafﬁc-signal controlled ramp and then returns to the proper side at the
next trafﬁc-signal controlled ramp. The crossover allows higher volume left-turn trafﬁc
to proceed with little disruption or interruption.

When you encounter this type of intersection:
• Watch for lane designation signs as well as pavement markings to guide you into the
  correct lane (see “Lane selection,”page 35).
• Trafﬁc going straight – watch for lane designation signs and ensure you’re in the
  correct lane to proceed straight. After the trafﬁc lights, don’t panic; you will be
  crossing onto the opposite side of the road for a short distance before crossing
  back onto the proper side at the next trafﬁc lights.
• Trafﬁc turning left – watch for lane designation signs and ensure you’re in the
  correct lane to turn left. After the trafﬁc lights, don’t panic; you will be crossing onto
  the opposite side of the road for a short distance before making your left turn.
• Trafﬁc turning right – normal right-hand turn procedures apply, so watch for lane
  designation signs and ensure you’re in the correct lane to turn right.

Restricted Crossing U-Turn
The Restricted Crossing U-Turn (RCUT)
intersection (also known as a reduced
conﬂict intersection) is designed to
decrease collisions caused by motorists
attempting to cross a four-lane divided
highway.

At an RCUT intersection, drivers always
make a right turn, followed by a U-turn.
Motorists approaching a divided highway
with an RCUT intersection are not allowed
to make a left turn or drive straight through
to cross the divided highway. Instead,
drivers must do the following:

1. Using the entrance ramp, make a right
   turn into the acceleration lane to enter
   the highway.
2. When it is safe to do so, signal, check
   your mirrors, shoulder check and
   change lanes into the far-left lane to
   enter the U-turn lane.




3. Complete the U-turn into the
   acceleration lane going the opposite
   direction.
4. When it is safe to do so, signal, check
   your mirrors, shoulder check and
   change lanes into the far right driving
   lane to continue straight or into the far
   right turning lane to complete a right
   turn.
5. Remember to shoulder check when
   changing multiple lanes.

      3.20 Highways • 3.21 Pedestrians



    3.20 Highways
    Driving to the left of centre
    You may not drive to the left of the roadway centre on two-way streets, roads or
    highways unless it’s safe and there’s no trafﬁc approaching.

    One-way highways
    You may not travel in the wrong direction on a one-way highway.

    Divided highways
    Travel in the right hand driving lane and only use the left lane for passing, turning left
    or emergency manoeuvers.

    Controlled access highways
    In the case of controlled access highways or freeways, you may not enter or leave
    except at the exit or entrance provided.


    3.21 Pedestrians
    When approaching an intersection, you must yield the right of way to any pedestrians
    who are crossing the street.

    You must stop your vehicle before the crosswalk, which will either be painted on the
    road or be an imaginary extension of the sidewalk. If a trafﬁc light changes while a
    pedestrian is in the crosswalk, the pedestrian has the right of way.

    You must stop your vehicle when directed to do so by a school crossing guard
    controlling a crosswalk.

    You may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an intersection to permit pedestrians
    to cross.

    As a pedestrian, you must not attempt to cross at an intersection unless you have
    given motorists a chance to stop.

    Pedestrians walking along a road should walk on the left shoulder, facing oncoming
    trafﬁc.

    Note: Pedestrians also include persons in wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs and
    medical scooters.

    Jaywalkers
    Jaywalking is when a pedestrian crosses a roadway in violation of trafﬁc laws, typically
    when crossing outside of a marked or unmarked intersection.
    You must always be prepared to stop if you see a pedestrian who is about to step out
    in front of you. But don’t encourage jaywalking by stopping and inviting pedestrians to
    cross. The car behind you may not be expecting you to stop and may collide with you.
    Also, drivers in the other lanes might not see the pedestrian crossing in front of your
    vehicle and may hit them.

3.22 Crossing urban streets
You may drive across a street only at an intersection, lane or alley.

Note: In some cities, crossing a street at a lane or alley is prohibited by a local bylaw.


3.23 Wheelchairs and medical scooters
The rules of the road that apply to pedestrians also
apply to persons using a wheelchair, motorized
wheelchair or medical scooter for medical reasons.

When approaching an intersection, you must yield the
right of way to any person crossing the street who is
using a wheelchair, motorized wheelchair or medical
scooter. This does not apply to wide streets if the
person in the wheelchair is at a safe distance from
your side of the street.

You must stop your vehicle before the crosswalk,
which will either be painted on the road or be an
imaginary extension of the sidewalk.

You may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an
intersection to permit persons using wheelchairs,
motorized wheelchairs or medical scooters to cross.

Persons in wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs or medical scooters must not attempt
to cross at an intersection unless they have given motorists a chance to stop.

The sidewalk should always be the ﬁrst choice while using a wheelchair, motorized
wheelchair or medical scooter. When there is no wheelchair accessible curb, get onto
the sidewalk using the ﬁrst available driveway.

Like pedestrians, persons using wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs or medical
scooters travelling along a road where no sidewalk exists should travel on the left
shoulder, facing oncoming trafﬁc. Wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs or medical
scooters should also have a brightly coloured ﬂag attached to increase visibility to
motorists.

    3.24 Motorcycles
    Although two motorcycles are permitted to drive in the same trafﬁc lane, it’s not
    recommended practice to operate directly alongside another motorcycle.

    Motorcycles may not travel beside any other type of vehicle in the same lane.




        Incorrect                                   Correct

    Drivers and passengers must wear an approved motorcycle helmet. If the motorcycle
    does not have a windshield that deﬂects the air stream away from the driver’s face,
    drivers and passengers must wear safety glasses, a face shield or goggles.

    For further information, refer to www.sgi.sk.ca/motorcyclehandbook.


    3.25 Medians
    Where a median, boulevard or ditch divides a road, you may not drive on the left side
    of it.
    You may not cross any median, boulevard or ditch except at an intersection or where
    a cross-over is provided.

3.26 Parking lots
Many rules of the road that apply to highways and streets also apply to parking lots,
such as speed, trafﬁc control signs, following too closely, proper turns, signalling
and backing.

When parking lanes and/or passageways intersect in a parking lot and don’t have
yield or stop signs, treat the area as an uncontrolled intersection - you must yield to
the vehicle on the right.

In some areas there are main roadways that provide access to one or more parking
lots – these are called thoroughfares. Thoroughfares lead into, through or out of a
parking lot and aren’t used for vehicle parking. Parking lanes and passageways within
a parking lot must yield to thoroughfares.




In the above illustration:
• Car A must yield to the car on its right, Car B.
• Car C must then yield to the vehicle in the thoroughfare, Car D.

      3.27 Headlights



    3.27 Headlights
    It’s advisable to have your lights on at all times because studies show that vehicles
    driven with lights on at all times are much less likely to be involved in collisions than
    those operated with their lights on at night only.

    The law requires the use of headlights from half an hour after sunset until half an hour
    before sunrise, and at any time when visibility is poor.

    Note: Some vehicles do not have tail lamps on when daytime running lights are
    being used. Always ensure you turn your headlights on at night, as it’s dangerous to
    operate a vehicle at night without them or your tail lamps illuminated.

    When using high beams, you must dim
    your headlights at least 200 m (650 ft.)
    in advance of oncoming vehicles and
    keep them dimmed until the vehicle has
    passed.

    Many drivers make the error of dimming
    their headlights too soon for oncoming       Low beams
    vehicles. For example, when driving
    at 100 km/h, you may not have to dim
    your high beams until the approaching
    vehicle is about seven to eight seconds
    away from you, but a realistic approach
    is to dim your lights between nine and
    12 seconds away.

    While you need to see the road, you          Low beams
    shouldn’t blind the oncoming driver with
    the glare of your lights. You may ﬁnd
    that some drivers approaching you will
    signal you to lower your lights while they
    are up to 20 seconds away. This applies
    to vehicles you are meeting and vehicles
    you are following. To avoid blinding
    other drivers, make sure your headlights
    are properly adjusted and are in working     High beams
    order.

Also, turn off any spotlamps at least 500 m (1,640 ft.) in advance of an oncoming
vehicle and keep them turned off until the vehicle has passed.

You don’t need to dim your headlights for oncoming trafﬁc if you’re driving on a
divided highway where the distance between the roadways is 22 m (70 ft.) or more
(the distance is measured from left shoulder marking to left shoulder marking in each
direction of travel).

You must keep your headlights on low beam within 100 m (330 ft.) and keep any
spotlamps or auxiliary driving lights turned off within 500 m (1,640 ft.) when you’re
following another vehicle, or when you’re being passed.

If you’ve been driving in the dark for a while, you will need up to ﬁve seconds to
recover from the glare of oncoming lights. This glare recovery time tends to increase
with age to the point where it sometimes takes up to 25 seconds to recover. If
you suspect you have a glare recovery problem, check with an ophthalmologist or
optometrist.


3.28 Night driving and low visibility
Driving at night is difﬁcult because the area illuminated by your headlights is not all
you need to see. Motorcycles, cyclists, pedestrians and wildlife are particularly difﬁcult
to see under these conditions — watch closely for them. If street lamps provide
overhead lighting, you can see well ahead. If not, you must rely on your headlights.
While driving at night, you should be able to see about 12 seconds travelling distance
in front of you. This means that most of the time, you should be using your high beam
headlights and be looking beyond the part of the road illuminated by your lights.

To reduce glare from other vehicles or lights to the rear, adjust your mirror or use
a day-night mirror turned to “night.” Dimming the dash lights will also improve your
ability to see the road.

      3.29 Choosing the right speed



    3.29 Choosing the right speed
    Driving without a full 12 seconds of view ahead means you are over-driving your
    headlights. This means by the time your headlights illuminate an object on the road
    you’ll be unable to stop before hitting it. This makes it critical to use all the other
    information available.

    Pay attention to other vehicles on the road, which can give you clues.

    If you can see the rear lights of the vehicle in front, you can be sure that no large
    object is between the two of you.

    The most important action that you can take at night is to slow immediately when you
    detect something on the road ahead. Don’t wait until you can see the object clearly –
    by that time, it will probably be too late to stop. As soon as you see something on the
    road, use your brakes so that you are slowing down while identifying what it is. You’ll
    then have more time to stop or change your direction if the need arises.

    4. Traﬃc signs and signals
    4.1 Trafﬁc signs
    Many collisions and near crashes occur as a result of drivers who ignore or fail to
    respond appropriately to trafﬁc signs. It’s essential that the meaning of trafﬁc signs
    be interpreted correctly. Signs are classiﬁed according to their function such as
    regulatory, warning and information.

    The easiest way to identify trafﬁc signs is to learn to recognize their shapes and
    colours. For safe driving, you must recognize and obey trafﬁc signs without hesitation.

    A sign-conscious driver is a safe driver. Keep a constant look-out for signs as you
    move your eyes in the ﬁeld of view ahead of you.


    4.2 Six basic sign shapes every driver must know

                           Stop
                           The stop sign, a red octagon with white lettering, means come
                           to a full stop and be sure the way is clear before proceeding.



                           Regulatory
                           Regulatory signs are white rectangles or squares with black
                           or other coloured lettering. These signs state the law, such
                           as speed limits, parking regulations and turning and passing
                           movements.

                           Yield
                           Yield right of way signs are triangular and have a red border on
                           a white background.
                           A yield sign means you must reduce speed when approaching
                           an intersection. Give right of way and stop if necessary if any
                           other trafﬁc is in, or closely approaching, the intersection.


                           Warning
                           Warning signs are diamond shaped and are yellow or orange
                           with black letters or symbols. They warn of dangerous or unusual
                           conditions ahead, such as a curve, turn, dip or side road.

                        Railway Crossing
                        The crossbuck is the traditional symbol at roadway-railway
                        crossings. The colour of the crossbuck is the same as a yield
                        sign and has the same meaning; give right of way and stop if
                        necessary.


                        School Zone (New)
                        The new school zone signs have a pentagon shape, with
                        a ﬂuorescent yellow-green background and show a black
                        silhouette of children.



                        School Zone (Old)
                        The old school zone sign has a pentagon shape, but with a blue
                        background and shows a white silhouette of children. These
                        signs are currently being replaced.




                        School Zone
                        When this sign has a “Maximum Speed” or “km/h During School
                        Days” tab mounted underneath, it means the speed is to be
                        observed as indicated.

    4.11 Railway crossings
    Drivers should check for trains at every crossing, even those
    equipped with automatic signals. Always proceed with caution
    when crossing railway tracks.

    Never get trapped on a crossing
    When trafﬁc is heavy, wait on the approach to a crossing until
    you’re sure you can clear it.

    When the last car of a train passes the crossing, do not
    start up until you’re sure no train is coming on another track,
    especially from the other direction.

    Never race a train
    Racing a train to the crossing is foolhardy. You may lose.

    Avoid shifting gears on a crossing
    If your vehicle has a manual transmission, shift down before
    the crossing.

    Watch for vehicles that must stop at crossings
    Be prepared to stop when you are following buses, school
    buses or large trucks that are required to stop.

    Automatic protected crossings
    Never drive around gates
    If the gates are down, don’t cross the tracks until the gates are
    raised. It’s against the law to go around crossing gates.

    Flashing lights
    At crossings without gates, you may cross the tracks, after
    stopping, while the red lights are ﬂashing if it’s safe to do so.
    However, if a train is closely approaching, or if a signal person
    signals you to stop, you must stop and wait until it’s safe
    to proceed. Some railway crossings may have an advance
    ﬂashing amber (yellow) light and sign warning of a train ahead
    at a concealed crossing.

A green light at an intersection means
you may turn left, right or drive straight
though the intersection, unless a sign
prohibits any of these movements,
once the intersection is clear and it’s
safe to do so.

If you want to turn left you can enter
the intersection on a green light,
but you must yield to oncoming
trafﬁc and pedestrians. If trafﬁc
is heavy, you may be forced to
complete your turn on an amber
(yellow) or red light.

You can often predict the appearance of an amber (yellow) light by taking note of how
long the light has been green and by watching for the “don’t walk” light, especially if it
is ﬂashing.

When approaching an amber (yellow) light at an intersection, you must stop before
entering the crosswalk. If you have already entered, or cannot stop safely, proceed
with caution.

When approaching a red light,
you must stop and remain
stopped until the light changes.
If you’re making a right turn at
an intersection, you may make
the turn, but only after stopping
and yielding the right of way to
pedestrians and to any vehicles
travelling through the intersection.
If you’re in the outside (left) lane of a double right turning
lane, you may also turn right after stopping and yielding the
right of way to pedestrians and vehicles. Use extra caution,
it’s not a common manoeuver.

This also applies to making a left turn at the intersection of
two one-way streets. Some intersections may have a sign
prohibiting turns on red lights.
You may not make a U-turn at any intersection where there are trafﬁc lights unless
there is a sign to indicate U-turns are permitted.

When approaching an amber (yellow) light, you must yield the right of way to any
pedestrians in the crosswalk or pedestrian corridor.

When approaching a ﬂashing red
light you must stop, but you may
then proceed when it’s safe.

Pedestrians may not cross an
intersection when they are facing
a red light, an amber (yellow) light
or a “don’t walk” light or symbol.
A ﬂashing “don’t walk” means
pedestrians should ﬁnish crossing
the street if they have already
started. Some signals have a
countdown showing how many
seconds remain before it is unsafe.

      5.1 Hazards




    5. Basic driving skills
    5.1 Hazards
    A hazard is a source of danger. When driving, it’s something that forces you to change
    your speed (usually to slow down) or change your steering (usually to steer around it)
    to avoid a collision.

    Real and potential hazards
    A real hazard is something that you have to react to. Examples of real hazards are: a
    stop light, a car moving slowly or stopping in your lane, a curve that requires you to
    slow down, a pedestrian or vehicle blocking you.




    Real hazard

    A potential hazard is something that might happen and you may have to react to: a car
    signalling the intention to change lanes, a car on the shoulder that might pull out, a
    pedestrian who might cross the road or a trafﬁc light that might change.




    Potential hazard

    These two types of hazards will be referred to frequently in the following sections.

5.2 The IPDE method of driving
We use the IPDE (Identify, Predict, Decide, Execute) approach to driving to deal with
potential and real hazards. IPDE deﬁnes the four steps involved.

           Identify              Predict           Decide              Execute

Identify
The ﬁrst step to good driving and avoiding collisions is to identify, well in advance, real
and potential hazards.

From the thousands of objects in your ﬁeld of vision, you must learn to ﬁlter out those
that do not provide you with information relevant to the driving task. For instance,
although a red neon sign attached to a restaurant may catch your eye, it’s an
unnecessary distraction because it’s irrelevant to the driving task. You must search
for real or potential hazards (such as trafﬁc lights or children) and give them your
immediate attention.

To use this information the hazard must be spotted in plenty of time. That’s why your
windows need to be clear.

Predict
Step two is to predict what will happen should you encounter a real or potential
hazard.




Real hazards
For a real hazard, such as a red light, stop sign or a stopped vehicle, you simply
predict whether or not the trafﬁc light will change or the vehicle will remain stopped.

You usually see real hazards in plenty of time and will have few problems predicting
what will happen. Although you may be scanning the road properly, a vehicle may
suddenly stop right in front of you. You will then have to quickly predict what may
happen in the next few seconds.

Potential hazard
Every vehicle you share the road with is a potential hazard. Be aware of where other
drivers could go. Make your best prediction of what they’re likely to do and keep
revising this prediction as you move towards them. Pedestrians, cyclists or children on
the side of the road are often potential hazards.

Predict the path of potential hazards. The vehicle may make a right turn. The child may
run across the road.

The more often you practise predicting what may happen and what pedestrians and
other drivers might do, the quicker you’ll be able to make accurate predictions.

         5.2 The IPDE method of driving



    Decide
    Step three is to decide exactly what you’ll do to drive smoothly and deal with the
    hazard. This means planning your actions in detail and checking to see that the way is
    clear to proceed.

    Real hazards
    You may decide to simply brake gently or change lanes to avoid the hazard, or you
    may want to brake hard, release the brakes and steer.

    Potential hazards
    When you encounter a potential hazard, you may decide to take no action and
    continue to monitor the actions of other drivers, or you may decide to take action to
    avoid the other vehicles.

    Consider the following steps before you take any action:
    1.    Check that your chosen gate is still open.
    2.    Check the surface condition of the roadway for braking.
    3.    Check the shoulder and the ditch.
    4.    Continue to watch the vehicle and decide whether you will take action to avoid it.




    Execute
    The ﬁnal step, to execute, means to carry out your decision.

    Executing some of your decisions will simply mean making a smooth stop at a
    trafﬁc light.

    Executing other decisions may involve using techniques for emergency driving.

    To be good at executing your decisions, particularly emergency decisions, you need
    to practise in a safe situation, preferably with a trained instructor. Practice helps you
    overcome the panic that usually arises the ﬁrst time you’re in an emergency.

    Practice makes perfect
    When you begin practising the IPDE method you’ll be slow and will probably think in
    words. As you practise, you’ll become faster and begin to think in ideas and pictures.
    At this stage, you will be able to carry out the entire procedure rapidly. You can cut
    your reaction time by taking the time to practise the IPDE method. It may save your
    life.

    Once you have been using IPDE for some time, much of your identifying, predicting,
    deciding and executing will be carried out instinctively.

    You’ll need to use IPDE more often in heavier trafﬁc and when you are driving at
    higher speeds.

You’ll ﬁnd that your physical condition greatly affects your ability to handle IPDE. If
you’re tired or ill, you should reduce the IPDE load by travelling at reduced speeds.
You can reduce the IPDE load by avoiding heavy trafﬁc. You might also consider not
driving.

Alcohol and other drugs make it very difﬁcult to carry out the IPDE process. Since
IPDE is designed to prevent you from having collisions, it’s not surprising that a large
number of crashes are alcohol-and drug-related.


5.3 Time – the key to judgment
It’s difﬁcult to judge how far things are ahead of you. It’s even more difﬁcult when
both your vehicle and the object outside the vehicle are moving. For example, can you
judge how far away an approaching car is?

We all have internal clocks. We all have an internal awareness of time. Why not use
time to measure how far ahead things are in day-to-day driving? You can do this by
counting seconds.

To count time in seconds, say out loud, “thou - sand one, thou - sand two, thou -
sand three,” at a normal speaking rate without pausing between the numbers. This will
give you a reasonably accurate count of three seconds.

Practise checking against your watch; you’ll be counting off perfect seconds in
no time.

 5     Basic driving skills
      5.3 Time – the key to judgment



    The language of time
    The most important skill in driving is being able to use your eyes effectively to seek
    out the information you need to drive. To use time as the basis for all of your driving,
    with special emphasis on your eye use, you need to understand the different ways of
    estimating time.

    First, you must be able to estimate, while you are driving, how far stationary objects or
    ﬁxed distances are from you. For example, the sign is nine seconds away and at 100
    km/h the spaces on the broken lines on the highway disappear about 12 seconds
    ahead.

    Estimate distance ahead in the
    following way:
    1. Pick a stationary object that is on or
       near the road (for example: a sign,
       shadow, overpass or pavement
       patch).
    2. Guess how many seconds the
       object is ahead.
    3. Then start counting “thou - sand
       one, thou - sand two, thou - sand
       three,” etc.
    4. When your front bumper is beside
       the object, stop counting. This will
       give you the number of seconds
       between you and the object chosen.
       If you guessed 15 seconds and
       the distance ahead is really eight
       seconds, then guess a lower number
       next time. Try for longer distance;
       see if you can guess how far away
       40 seconds is. This way you’ll
       improve your judgment.
    5. Continue practising this exercise
       until you can judge time accurately.
    The relationship between time and distance varies with speed. Therefore, begin by
    making all your judgments at the same speed. Then, practise at other speeds at which
    you most commonly drive, say 100, 80 and 50 km/h.




                                                86

5.3 Time – the key to judgment
                                                                                           5
Using time to estimate your following distance
When you are driving, estimate the
distance between you and the vehicle in
front in the following way:

1. Pick something that is on or near the
   road and is not moving (for example,
   a sign, pavement patch, shadow or
   overpass).
2. When the back bumper of the vehicle
   ahead is even with the object you have
   chosen, start counting – “thou - sand
   one, thou - sand two, thou - sand
   three,” etc.
3. When your front bumper is beside the
   object, stop counting. This will give you
   the number of seconds between you
   and the vehicle you are following.
4. If you are closer than three seconds,
   drop back and check again until you
   have achieved a minimum of three-
   seconds following distance. Any
   following distance longer than that
   is safe. However, a longer following
   distance is recommended when
   following a motorcycle.

You will notice that by keeping a three-second following distance, regardless of your
speed, the distance between you and the vehicle in front will automatically lengthen
as you go faster. So, for a three-second following distance at 100 km/h, you will be
twice as far back as you would be at 50 km/h and four times as far back as you would
be at 25 km/h.

    For a three-second following distance at 100 km/h, you will be twice as far back as
    you would be at 50 km/h.

    There is one situation where a three-second following distance is not enough. If you
    are following a large truck or van that blocks your view of trafﬁc ahead, drop back to
    more than three seconds until you can see around the vehicle.




        Incorrect




        Correct

    You may feel that if you try to keep a three-second following distance, other drivers
    will cut into the space you leave. This will happen sometimes, but less often than you
    think. To give up your sight distance, your planning and response time and relaxed
    driving just because you want to save a few seconds and not let other drivers cut in,
    is a poor bargain. If you let other drivers dictate your driving style, then you’re not
    in control.

The three-second following distance is recommended when driving conditions are
ideal. If driving conditions are less than ideal, your following distance should increase
accordingly.

To understand why, you will need to examine how three seconds would be spent in a
situation that could turn into a collision.

First, you’ll spend some of the three seconds identifying the problem, predicting the
outcome and deciding what to do, through the IPDE approach to driving. Then you
need some reaction time – to get your foot off the accelerator and apply the brake. If
you’re reasonably alert, you can do all of this in three seconds and begin braking, too.

If you stop at the same rate as the vehicle ahead, you‘ll not hit it.

But, if the driver in front hits a ﬁxed object; you’re tired and are slower to react than
the other driver; the other vehicle has better traction; or, the other driver is more
skilled at braking than you are, then you need more than three seconds to avoid a
collision.

However, if you’re looking ahead as far as you should, you’ll see the cause of the
problem any time from 12 to 60 seconds ahead – possibly before the driver ahead
of you sees it. In this case, you can respond to the problem rather than to the brake
lights of the vehicle in front of you.

      5.4 Eye use



    5.4 Eye use
    Of all your senses, your eyesight is the most important for driving. Your eyes pick up
    most of the information you need to drive.

    Steer where you look
    It’s important to understand that your eyes determine the path your vehicle follows
    – you steer where you look.

    To illustrate this, pick a straight stretch
    of paved highway with light trafﬁc.
    While driving, look at the centre line
    about 12 seconds ahead. Keep looking
    at the centre line 12 seconds ahead.
    Observe how the car moves toward the
    centre line.

    Now, look at the edge of the road
    12 seconds ahead.

    You will steer where you look.

    To steer straight ahead, look about
    12 seconds directly ahead of where
    you are sitting.

    To steer around a curve, look at the
    inside of the curve to where the centre
    lines vanish. Do not look in the mirrors,
    don’t look down at your instrument
    panel. If you take your eyes off the road,
    you will not maintain precise control
    over your steering.

    Remember, if you look at the side of the
    road, you’ll steer to the side of the road.
    Look where you want to go, particularly
    in an emergency or a skid, and steer
    there.

    Check your mirrors and speed when
    you’re driving in a straight line, and
    when steering is less critical.

Search patterns on highways and rural roads
When you drive on a highway, you hope the road is clear and unobstructed. To verify
that, you’ll need to perform a search pattern – searching the road for any obstructions
or hazards.

Looking up on highways
As part of your search pattern, look up as far as you can see. To look up means to
look as far ahead as you can see the highway – to the horizon (on a straight road, you
may be able to see up to 90 seconds ahead).




                                          91
 5     Basic driving skills
      5.4 Eye use



    On a curve, look up across and around as far ahead as you can see. At ﬁrst, you’ll
    likely have to concentrate to look this far ahead in curves.

    When curving right, look at the shoulder line to the point where it disappears. Keep
    looking at that point and maintain a steady speed. When curving left, look at the
    centre line as far as you can see it. When coming out of the curve, look at your lane all
    the way to the horizon.

    As you develop that “far ahead” view, you’ll automatically drive the curve smoothly and
    accurately. You’ll also beneﬁt from seeing your path far enough ahead to deal with any
    obstacles in your path.

Referencing down on highways
Reference down by moving your eyes down from the look up position so that you see
the road 12 seconds ahead at 100 km/h.

Look on the road in front of you to where the spaces on the broken lines on the road
disappear. This will be about 12 seconds away. This will help you obtain information
you require to steer accurately and safely.

Until now, you have been looking up (to the horizon), referencing down (12 seconds
ahead), looking up, referencing down, etc.

When most people try this exercise, they usually ﬁnd that they have not been looking
up as far as they can see. Also, they have usually been referencing down much closer
than 12 seconds.

To establish search patterns of up to 90 seconds ahead and to stretch your
referencing down to 12 seconds requires two things. First, most drivers must admit
that they haven’t been looking far enough ahead. Second, you have to practise to
make looking up and referencing down a habit.

As you establish the habit of looking up and referencing down, you’ll see the beneﬁts
to your driving, and this method will become easier every day. Also, steering where
you look will help you overcome steering problems such as wandering within a lane or
wandering from lane to lane.




Sweeping highways with your eyes
The next part of your search pattern is to look for things that will interfere with your
path – vehicles entering from the side, animals or people on the side of the road, or
approach roads. This involves sweeping your eyes across and to the side of the road.
Try to sweep about 12 seconds ahead.

Filling in the gap on highways
Now ﬁll in the gap between you and where you reference down 12 seconds ahead.
Check the vehicles in front, the road surface for ice or pot holes, and the width and
ﬁrmness of the shoulders.

Checking your gates on highways
Next, you need to check which gates are still open; that is, the space around your
vehicle on all four sides. Pay close attention if you have detected a real or potential
hazard. Check your mirrors often to see whether the rear and two side gates are
open.

 5     Basic driving skills
      5.4 Eye use



    Checking your instruments on highways
    You should check your instruments when it’s safe to take your eyes off the road. Even
    checking your speed takes one and a half seconds. Therefore, check your instruments
    when you’re on a straight stretch of road with your gates open and with no real or
    potential hazards ahead.

    Check your speed and, less often, glance at your gas gauge and other instruments or
    warning lights.




    Now your pattern should be: look up, reference down, look up, reference down,
    sweep left, sweep right, look up, reference down, ﬁll in the gap, look up, reference
    down, check your gates, look up, reference down, check instruments, etc.

    The exact sequence that you use will vary with the features and the trafﬁc on the
    highway. The most important part of the sequence is to look up and reference down.
    Include the others as needed. The more often the situation changes around you, the
    more often you have to search.

    Search patterns in urban areas
    The pattern for city driving is similar to that of highway driving. It‘s not easy to achieve,
    but is worth practising.

    Looking up in urban areas
    To look up in an urban area, look ahead as far as you can see – usually several
    trafﬁc lights or a number of blocks ahead. This will give you information about the
    ﬂow of trafﬁc, the sequence of the lights and whether there is construction or major
    obstructions ahead.

    Referencing down in urban areas
    Next in the sequence, you should reference down. To reference down in an urban
    area, move your eyes down from the look up position so that you view the road 12
    seconds ahead at city speeds. Even if you cannot see clearly for that distance, you
    should look around or through the windows of the vehicles ahead. Try to see cars well
    ahead that are slowing down, changing lanes, turning or stopping. Watch for brake
    and signal lights.

Sweeping with your eyes in urban areas
In the city you need to sweep further to each side and sweep more frequently than
you do on the highway.

The sequence now should be: look up, reference down, look up, reference down,
sweep left, sweep right, look up, reference down, etc.

Filling in the gap in urban areas
You need to ﬁll in the gap between you and where you reference down, 12 seconds
ahead. In the city, you need to do this more often than on the highway because you
do not have as clear a view ahead.

Checking your gates in urban areas
You need to be more aware of the status of your gates when driving in the city
because vehicles are more likely to be in your blind spot.

Never permit yourself to drive in a situation where there are fewer than two gates
open. If you cannot control the rear and side gates, at least you can drop back and
double the distance between you and the vehicle ahead – to ﬁve or six seconds.

Checking your instruments in urban areas
You’ll have little time to check your instruments when driving in the city. From time
to time, check your speed. But remember to do this in light trafﬁc or on straight,
unobstructed roads. You can check your gauges at trafﬁc lights and stop signs.

Search patterns at night
At night, your search pattern is much the same as it is during the day. You should look
up and reference down to about 12 seconds ahead. This means that most of the time
you’ll be looking beyond the part of the road illuminated by your lights.

You still need to sweep with your eyes, ﬁll in the gap and check your gates and
instruments.

Do not look at the side of the road because you will steer there. Obviously, don’t look
at oncoming headlights because the glare will blind you. Look 12 seconds ahead,
directly in line with where you are sitting.

Search patterns in emergencies
The rule for where to look in emergencies is simple: look where you want to go and
steer there.

If you are sliding or skidding sideways, don’t look down, don’t look at the instrument
panel and don’t look at what you might hit. Look where you want to go.

    Preventing potential collisions
    Most collisions occur at intersections and cross roads. To help you spot and prevent a
    potential collision, use the following method.

    Scenario:
    You’re driving on a road towards an intersection and spot another vehicle approaching
    the same intersection. You don’t know how fast the other vehicle is travelling or how
    far away it is from the intersection. To help you determine if a collision is imminent,
    maintain your speed and course, and turn your head to take note of the other vehicle’s
    position in relation to you. Continue to maintain your speed and course for a few
    seconds and check the other vehicle’s position again by turning your head. If the other
    vehicle is still at the same position, you’re on a collision course. Start slowing down,
    and be prepared to yield or stop to avoid a collision.




                                                       collision


            Slow down here.
                Be prepared
             to yield or stop.



                                                       60°




                                                       60°




    It’s important to turn your head while looking for approaching vehicles and not rely on
    your peripheral vision only. Peripheral vision is very good at picking out objects that
    are moving; however, in the above scenario the other vehicle would appear to be not
    moving as it’s in a ﬁxed position in your peripheral view.

Driving in dense trafﬁc
If you’re not accustomed to driving in
dense trafﬁc, the experience can be
highly stressful. You can make it easier
if you plan where you wish to go in
advance. It’s nerve wracking to drive in a
new environment and to try to navigate
at the same time.

The most important thing to remember
is don’t give up your following distance.
Don’t stop your search pattern. If the
drivers around you are driving one
second apart, let them, but don’t be
tempted to follow their example.

5.5 Before you drive
Vehicle familiarization
Many drivers have collisions during their ﬁrst week of owning a new car because they
don’t know where the controls are.

Whenever you get into a vehicle that is new to you, take time to ﬁnd out where the
controls are. You must be able to operate the windshield wipers, windshield washers,
horn, lights, heater, radio, turn signals and hazard lights without looking at them. With
the vehicle stationary, practise looking at the road ahead while you reach and adjust
each control.

Read the owner’s manual. New vehicles have new design features that you should be
familiar with if you’re to drive safely and get maximum enjoyment and efﬁciency from
your vehicle’s equipment. Visit mycardoeswhat.org to learn more about how to use
safety technology and features such as back-up cameras, lane departure alerts, and
blind spot detection.

Before you drive check that:
• doors are properly closed (if security is an issue, you may want to lock your doors)
• all loose objects are secured
• your seat is properly adjusted
• head restraints are properly adjusted
• mirrors are properly adjusted
• air ﬂow regulators are adjusted (vents, heaters, air conditioning)
• seatbelts are fastened and properly adjusted
• bulbs in warning lights are working and the lights go out when the engine starts (see
  owner’s manual)

Should an engine or oil warning light come on while operating your vehicle, the cause
should be determined as soon as safely possible. Continuing to drive with a warning
light on may cause damage to the vehicle.

    Design components for safety
    Vehicle designers must prevent injury and reduce the seriousness of injury in crashes
    by building safety features into the design of every vehicle.

    Important safety features include head restraints, seatbelts and airbags.

    Head restraints
    In some vehicles, the head restraints are built into the seat, while in others you have to
    adjust them.

    If your vehicle is hit from behind, or if you hit someone in front, you are much less likely
    to suffer a whiplash injury to your neck if your head restraint is properly adjusted.

    Adjust the height of the head restraint for each driver or passenger. The protection
    afforded is well worth the effort.

    Adjust the pad of the restraint to support the back of your head. The top of your head
    restraint should never be lower than the top of your head.

Seatbelts
A safe passenger compartment is an important part of vehicle design. The front and
rear of a car are designed to collapse on impact while the passenger compartment
remains undisturbed. Your chances of survival are, therefore, greatly increased if you
remain in the passenger compartment.

Your seatbelt will keep you in your seat and will reduce the forces your body
experiences in a crash.

In Saskatchewan, every vehicle occupant must wear a seatbelt where they are
provided in a properly adjusted and securely fastened manner. Obey the law and
increase your chances of surviving a collision. Put on your seatbelt every time you ride
in a vehicle. To be most effective, seatbelts must be used properly. First, put the lap
belt on, adjusting it to ﬁt over your pelvis, and pull it snug. The lap belt is designed to
take the force on your pelvis – not your stomach. Keep the lap portion low.

Next, adjust the shoulder portion of the seatbelt over your chest area. How you do this
will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Some adjust automatically, others work like a window
blind. Adjust your shoulder belt to make it snug, yet comfortable. Shoulder belts
should never be worn behind your back or under your arm.




Lap belt                                      Shoulder belt

Drivers are legally responsible to ensure that passengers under 16 years of age use
seatbelts where available and child safety seats, when appropriate. If not, the driver
may be charged. Passengers aged 16 years and older are responsible for buckling
themselves up.

Being a safety-minded driver means you make sure everyone in your vehicle is
properly secured. Without a seatbelt or proper child safety seat a passenger can
become a dangerous ﬂying object during a collision.

    Car seats and booster seats
    In Saskatchewan, children under seven years old must be properly ﬁtted into correctly
    installed and approved car seats or booster seats for their size, weight, height and age.
    This is to make sure their smaller bodies are kept safe and not seriously injured in a
    collision. These seats belong in the back seat away from air bags. Children will not be
    protected by a regular seatbelt alone until they are large enough and old enough, which
    is usually age seven and when they weigh more than 36 kg (80 lb.).

    Car seats or booster seats must be used no matter who is transporting the child,
    including grandparents, caregivers and if they’re in a taxi or rideshare vehicle.

    For more information on car seats, contact Trafﬁc Safety Community Outreach

Airbags
Almost all vehicles are equipped with air
bags. The tough fabric bags inﬂate in crashes
over 16 km/h, cushioning an occupant’s neck,
head and chest in moderate to severe impact.

Children should never be put in the front
seat of cars equipped with passenger-side
airbags. The force of an airbag deploying is
enough to critically injure or kill an infant or
small child.



Airbags are not a replacement for seatbelts. Seatbelts alone provide all the protection
a person needs in low and moderate-speed impacts. Airbags are most effective in
high-speed crashes, where they often prevent serious injury.

Driver-side and passenger-side airbags are common features in newer automobiles.
Airbags are also installed in the doors of some cars to prevent passengers from
hitting their heads against the windows or pillars of the car during a collision.

Occupants must wear seatbelts to protect themselves in these circumstances and
to ensure that in the event of a frontal crash, they remain in the seating position
necessary for airbags to be effective.

Mirror adjustment
Proper mirror adjustment is critical to safe driving. The following page outlines an
excellent method to adjust your vehicle’s mirrors to maximize your view of the road.
Remember, always adjust your mirrors before you start to drive.

Begin with the rear-view mirror. Adjust the mirror so that you’re able to see as much of
the rear window as possible. While adjusting the mirror, aim to keep your head in the
same position as it will be when you are actually driving your vehicle.

Adjusting your side mirror is a little more difﬁcult. First, lean to the left so that your
forehead is barely touching the side window. Then move the mirror so you can just
see the left side of your vehicle.

To adjust the right side mirror, position your head toward the centre of your vehicle.
Adjust the mirror so it shows just a sliver of the right side of your vehicle.




By setting mirrors so the driver can see both sides of the vehicle from the driving
position, the same image will appear in all three mirrors. By setting them so the driver
has to lean to see the sides of the car, the outside mirrors continue on where the
inside mirror leaves off – signiﬁcantly reducing the blind spot.

Another advantage of positioning your mirrors this way is that it reduces headlight
glare from vehicles travelling behind you.

Left foot brace
The left foot brace refers to the bracing of your
left foot against the ﬁre wall (located below and
behind the pedals separating the engine from the
driving compartment) to support you and to keep
you ﬁrmly in your seat.

Place your left foot against the ﬁre wall and
push whenever you need stability such as
when negotiating a curve, when braking, in an
emergency or on slippery pavement.

 5     Basic driving skills
      5.5 Before you drive • 5.6 Steering



    Bracing with your left foot helps you steer easily and well because you are not leaning
    on the wheel. Also, if you’re not supporting your weight on the heel of your right foot,
    it is free to brake and accelerate with greater precision and control.

    The fact that you need a left foot brace for controlled driving means you cannot use
    your left foot to brake. Always brake with your right foot.


    5.6 Steering
    Hand positions
    There are two correct hand positions on a steering wheel: “9 and 3” and “8 and 4.”




    “9 and 3”                                    “8 and 4”

    These methods refer to visualizing the steering wheel as the face of a clock, and
    positioning the left hand at the 9 or 8 and the right hand at the 3 or 4 o’clock position.
    Steering wheels and shoulder widths differ, so exactly where people grasp the wheel
    will vary.

    On a vehicle equipped with an airbag in the steering wheel, a hand placed on the
    top of the wheel may be forced back into the driver’s face if the airbag is deployed,
    causing injury.

    Once your hands are in correct position, don’t shufﬂe them around on the wheel.
    Keep your grip in the same place and simply twist the steering wheel to turn the
    vehicle.

    You can twist the wheel until your forearms touch. To steer beyond this point, you‘ll
    have to use a “hand over hand” or “hand to hand” steering sequence.

    The key to steering is to know the steering wheel position at which your front wheels
    are straight. When you start out, straighten your front wheels and place your hands in
    position. Provided that you don’t shift your grip, every time your hands are straight and
    level, you know your front wheels are straight.

“Hand over hand”
This method is used when turning the wheel sharply either when driving slowly or in
emergencies when conditions are very slippery.

As you turn the wheel, pull the wheel down with the top hand, take the bottom hand
and put it up at the top, pull the wheel down with the top hand, take the bottom hand
and put it at the top, etc.

When unwinding the wheel after a turn, use the hand over hand system. Don’t let the
wheel slide through your hands – you have very little control of the speed at which it
comes back or the point at which it stops.




“Hand-to-hand”
Commonly called push/pull steering or zone steering, when using the hand-to-hand
steering method, your left hand grasps the wheel between 7 and 8 o’clock, and your
right hand between 4 and 5 o’clock. Depending on the direction you turn, your right or
left hand pushes the wheel up and the opposite hand slides up, grasps the wheel and
pulls down to turn.

While the pulling hand moves down, the hand that initially pushed up slides back
toward its original position to make adjustments as needed. The driver should use
the area on the wheel between 11 and 8 o’clock with the left hand and the area on
the wheel between 1 and 8 o’clock with the right hand regardless of the direction of
the turn.

Simply reverse the process to bring the vehicle back to the desired path. Since your
hands never cross over the steering wheel, there is less chance of an injury to the
face, hands or arms induced by your hands or arms in the event of a frontal crash due
to an air bag.

 5     Basic driving skills
      5.7 Accelerating • 5.8 Standard (manual) transmission vehicles



    5.7 Accelerating
    To move the vehicle smoothly and to save on fuel, push the accelerator down
    gradually and wait for the vehicle to build up speed.

    In vehicles with automatic transmissions, the gears will change automatically for
    you. With manual transmissions, you have to release the accelerator and re-apply
    accelerator pressure as part of your gear shift.

    To drive with precision, you must vary the accelerator position smoothly by small
    amounts. Accelerating too quickly can lead to a loss of control of the vehicle,
    especially on gravel, snow or ice.


    5.8 Standard (manual) transmission vehicles
    Driving a vehicle with a standard (manual) transmission requires signiﬁcant practice
    and skill. Drivers should read the vehicle owner’s manual for information speciﬁc to
    their vehicle.

    Neutral/clutch
    • know your gear pattern so you are able to shift gears without looking at the gear shift
    • take the engine’s rpm (revolutions per minute), choice of gear and road speed into
      consideration when shifting gears
    • shift gears in order (e.g., 2 to 3 to 4, or 4 to 3 to 2)
    • never force a gear
    • never coast in neutral
    • never depress the clutch (riding the clutch) for extended periods of time. The clutch
      should only be used when starting and stopping the vehicle, and to change gears.
    • become familiar with accelerator and clutch timing. Poor timing from one to the
      other can cause the vehicle to jolt, jump, stall or roll backward when starting on
      a hill or slope.

    You should shift to neutral (or declutch) during emergencies or when stopping
    in winter driving conditions. This gives you better control over your vehicle by
    disconnecting the engine from the drive wheels. If you’re stopping on a slippery
    surface and are in neutral, then your drive wheels are not driving the car forward while
    you are trying to stop. You stop more easily over a shorter distance.

    To shift to neutral, declutch by pushing the clutch to the ﬂoor and hold it there, and
    move the gear shift lever to neutral.

    When parking a vehicle, ensure the vehicle is in (ﬁrst) gear, not in neutral, before
    leaving the vehicle. This is to prevent the vehicle from freely moving forward or
    backward while parked.

    Standard (manual) transmission training is available from certain SGI certiﬁed
    driver educators.

    Use the Driver Educator locator at www.sgi.sk.ca/drivereducator for a list of SGI
    certiﬁed driver educators.

5.9 Automatic transmission vehicles
Most vehicles on the road are equipped with automatic transmissions. An automatic
transmission placed in drive “D” is designed to change gears automatically without
any driver assistance. This type of transmission selects the most efﬁcient gear based
on speed and acceleration.

It’s possible for the driver to make an automatic transmission shift by simply using the
accelerator pedal:

To shift to a higher gear - ease up slightly on the accelerator.

To shift to a lower gear - push the accelerator to the ﬂoor. This technique is used for
passing or to get out of an emergency situation quickly.

When driving down a steep hill, you can slow your vehicle by manually shifting to a
lower gear and using engine compression as a braking effect. Simply move the gear
shift lever from the drive “D” position to the next lower gear (usually third or second
gear). It is recommended to make your gear selection at the top of the hill before you
start going down. If you have to make the shift while driving down the hill, release the
accelerator and use your brake to slow the vehicle down before moving the shift lever.
To avoid engine damage, pay attention to ensure that the rpm’s stay out of the red
zone as you shift to a lower gear. You should use the brakes only as needed. Holding
the brake pedal for an extended length of time may cause the brakes to overheat,
which can result in a loss of braking ability.


5.10 Low speed skills
Surprisingly, certain low speed skills can be quite tricky. You need to drive slowly to
park, turn sharply, back up or move forward in trafﬁc jams.

Low speed manoeuvring
To drive slowly in an automatic-transmission vehicle, rest your foot on the brake and
let the idling speed of the engine move the vehicle, braking as necessary to control
the speed.

In a manual-transmission vehicle, you control very low speeds almost entirely with the
clutch. Accelerate as for a normal start and hold your engine speed constant. Raise
the clutch to the point at which the engine engages with the drive wheels, and stop.
Then, ease the clutch up a small amount to move the vehicle. To gain speed, ease the
clutch up a little more. To slow the vehicle, push the clutch down a small amount until
the engine is again disengaged from the drive wheels.

If the vehicle is on a slope and/or is moving faster than you wish, declutch and
brake gently.

    Backing
    You might think that being good at backing isn’t important. However, collisions while
    backing are among the most frequent type of collision. This is due, in part, to drivers
    who believe that a low-speed activity such as backing is no problem.

    Best practices for safe backing
    1. Check your surroundings:
       • Always check behind your vehicle
         before backing up.
       • Children, pets, bicycles, wagons,
         etc., aren’t always visible from inside
         your vehicle.
       • Make sure the path is clear before
         you start backing up.
    2. Prepare your vehicle:
       • All backing manoeuvres should
         begin with the vehicle straight and
         the front wheels straight.
       • Adjust your mirrors and ensure your backup camera (if equipped) is clean and
         operational.
    3. Using the backup camera:
       • Check all angles — while backup cameras are helpful, they don’t capture
         everything. Always turn your head to look out the rear window and check in all
         directions.
       • Mirrors and camera — use your mirrors in conjunction with the backup camera to
         get a comprehensive view of your surroundings.
    4. Proper positioning for backing:
       • From your normal seating position, shift your weight so that you’re resting on
         your right hip.
       • Support yourself by placing your right arm along the armrest or the top of the
         front passenger seat.
       • Grasp the top centre (12 o’clock position) of the steering wheel with your left
         hand.
    5. Starting to back up:
       • While looking out the rear window, begin backing slowly in a straight line. Within
         the ﬁrst foot or so of vehicle movement, check forward. If the front of the vehicle
         is moving straight back, your front wheels are straight. If the front of the vehicle
         swings to the left or right, your wheels are not straight.
       • If the front of your vehicle swings to the left, turn your steering wheel to the left
         to straighten. If the front swings to the right, turn your steering wheel to the right
         to straighten. Once you get the wheels straight, move your grip to the new 12
         o’clock position.
       • Having done this, you know that every time your hand is at 12 o’clock, your front
         wheels are straight.

6. Focus and control:
   • Look through the rear window and focus your eyes well back along the path you
     want to go.
   • Move the vehicle slowly backward. Look and steer where you want to go.
   • You’ll notice that the vehicle turns much more when you are backing because
     the front wheels are pivoting, or swinging, around the rear wheels. This is called
     ‘front end swing’ and is the cause of many backing collisions.

Additional tips for using technology
• Backup sensors: Many vehicles are equipped with backup sensors that alert you
    if you’re getting too close to an object. Pay attention to these alerts but do not rely
    solely on them.
• 360-degree cameras: Some vehicles offer a 360-degree view, which can provide a
    better overall perspective. Use this feature to enhance your situational awareness.
• Blind spot monitoring: Utilize any blind spot monitoring systems to assist in
    detecting vehicles or objects that you might not see when backing up.
By combining these technologies with proper visual search patterns and cautious
driving, you can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of collisions while backing up. Remember,
technology is there to assist you, but your primary focus should always be on visually
conﬁrming your surroundings and backing up safely.

 5     Basic driving skills
      5.10 Low speed skills




    Steering techniques for backing
    1. Hand over hand and hand-to-hand
       Shift your weight slightly onto your right hip, grasp the steering wheel with both
       hands and use the hand over hand method to turn the steering wheel. While this
       method provides good steering control, it limits your ability to see out the back
       window. For the hand-to-hand method, refer to “5.6 Steering”.
    2. Palming (precision backing technique)
       Palming is an advanced steering technique that’s
       only used when backing. It’s used in situations
       where both straight line backing and sharp turning
       are required. This method allows you to turn the
       wheel sharply while ensuring that your front wheels
       will be straight when your hand is at 12 o’clock.
       Put your left hand at the 12 o’clock position but
       do not grasp the wheel. Instead, push your palm
       against the rim of the wheel with enough pressure
       so that when you move your hand down and
       around, the wheel turns, but your palm stays on
       the same place on the wheel rim.

Parallel parking
First, ﬁnd a space that you can ﬁt your vehicle into. Signal your intention to park to
other drivers as you approach. If you’re not sure, stop your vehicle beside the space
and check that you have at least 2 m more than the length of your vehicle. Shift to
reverse as soon as possible to activate the back-up lights.

This is only one suggested method of parallel parking. There are others that work just
as well.

1. Position your vehicle parallel to the front vehicle about .5 m out from it, with your
   back bumper lined up with the front vehicle’s back bumper. Shift to reverse, check
   that the way is clear and get ready to steer.




2. Back slowly. Immediately start turning your wheel toward the curb until you reach
   about a 45 degree angle. (Pay attention to your vehicle’s front end swing into
   trafﬁc. Make sure you are clear of oncoming vehicles.)




3. Continue to back slowly and straighten your wheels.

      6.1 Parking



    4. When your front bumper clears the bumper of the front vehicle, continue to move
       slowly and turn your wheels away from the curb.




    5. If necessary, shift to ﬁrst or drive, and slowly move forward while you straighten
       your vehicle.




    Back-up cameras
    Driving assist options are becoming increasingly more standard on new vehicles.
    However, they aren’t substitutes for proper driving techniques. In the case of back-up
    cameras, the sun can interfere with the view as can snow, or dirt. Before reversing,
    look over your shoulder and use your mirrors to check behind you. Shift into reverse
    to activate the back-up camera. As you back up, check the monitor for objects while
    being aware of your surroundings. Observe your mirrors and check or look through
    the rear window. Don’t rely primarily on the monitor when backing.

Angle parking
Where a parking space is at 90 degrees (a right angle) to the road, as it is in most
parking lots, it’s recommended that you back into the space, unless prohibited. You
have the advantage of being able to back in accurately because your windows are
clear and you are warmed up for driving. In addition, the front end swing occurs in the
aisle, not between two parked cars and you’re backing into a space you know is free
of obstacles instead of backing into trafﬁc. More importantly, when you drive out you
will have an excellent view.




Some parking spaces are at about a 60 degree angle to the road. These spaces are
usually located in small urban centres and on one-way streets. You’re meant to drive
into and back out of them.




Steps in angle parking:
1. Signal your intention to park and slow down.
2. Check for approaching trafﬁc from the front and rear.
3. Approach the stall approximately one vehicle width from the parked vehicles.
4. When your vehicle’s front end is even with the rear of the stall you want to park in,
    begin steering sharply to the right while slowly driving towards the centre of the
    stall. Remember, as you’re turning into the stall, to check that you will not hit the
    vehicle on either side of the stall.

 6     Advanced driving skills
      6.1 Parking • 6.2 Turning



    5. Once your vehicle is centred in the stall, straighten your wheels and continue driving
        forward until you are completely in the parking stall. Although it’s easy to park,
        backing out from this position can be hazardous. Shoulder check both your sides
        and rear — don’t just rely on your rearview mirror. Make sure it’s clear behind and
        on both sides before backing up. If your vision is blocked, for example, by a truck
        parked beside you, move back cautiously and watch for pedestrians or vehicles
        that you may not have seen.

    Parking on a hill
    The trick to parking on a hill is to turn your front wheels so that if the vehicle rolls
    away, it will roll into the curb and stop. If there is no curb, the vehicle should roll off
    the road, not into the path of other vehicles. This will prevent the vehicle from building
    momentum and will stop it from entering the street. The emergency brake should be
    applied whenever parking on a slope.

    6.2 Turning
    U-turns
    A U-turn is when you turn your vehicle around at an intersection to travel in the
    opposite direction. Before making a U-turn, check that:
    • there are no signs prohibiting U-turns
    • you have adequate sight distance so you have time to ﬁnish the turn before
      encountering oncoming trafﬁc. For example, in a 60 km/h area, you need a sight time
      of at least 20 seconds each way. In a 100 km/h area, you need 40 seconds sight
      distance clear of vehicles each way
    • you have enough room to make the turn in one swing

    If there is any doubt whether a U-turn can be made safely and with minimal disruption
    to trafﬁc, go around the block.

    The procedure for making a U-turn:
    1. Check that the turn is allowed and the way is clear.
    2. Signal the turn and approach as you would a left turn.
    3. Move very slowly. Turn the wheel into a full lock as soon as you can (use hand over
       hand).
    4. Once you are on full lock, slightly increase your speed.
    5. Throughout the turn, check to see that the way is still clear (both ways).

6. Complete the turn. Before the car is straight, start unwinding the wheel (hand over
   hand).
7. Straighten your front wheels.
8. Proceed as normal.

U-turns are prohibited at trafﬁc lights unless permitted by a sign.




When making U-turns every effort should be made to complete the turn in the most
extreme left driving lane.

Two-point turns
Before making a two-point turn, check that you have adequate sight distance so
that you have time to ﬁnish the turn before any possible vehicle conﬂict occurs. For
example, in a 60 km/h area, you need a sight time of at least 20 seconds each way. In
a 100 km/h area, you need 40 seconds sight distance clear of vehicles, each way.
1. Well before the place where you wish to turn around, signal right, shoulder check,
   position your vehicle in the right lane and slow down.
2. Cancel the signal, proceed past the intersection, and stop your vehicle as far right
   as possible.
   You may also move to the far right after the intersection and stop your vehicle as
   illustrated on the next page. Choose whichever method can be done most safely
   given the trafﬁc ﬂow.

    3. Signal right or turn on four-way ﬂashers. Check for trafﬁc.
    4. Begin slowly backing up. When the rear bumper is even with the intersection, turn
       wheels sharply to the right. Be careful that the front of your car does not swing out
       into trafﬁc. As you back into the approach, straighten the wheels and stop.
    5. Signal for a left turn, check for trafﬁc and proceed to make a left turn into the left
       driving lane.




    6.3 Highway driving
    Highway driving requires rapid acceleration to build up speed over as short a time as
    possible to minimize the difference in speed with other vehicles. It’s very important
    that you have a good judgment of the amount of time you need to safely enter the
    highway and that it matches the amount of time you actually have.

    Some things to remember while highway driving:
    • It takes a longer time to stop from higher speeds.
    • Some drivers who have been driving for a number of hours can develop “highway
      hypnosis.” They may not see your brake lights or turn signal. Be prepared to make
      your movements obvious and for a potential slow reaction by other drivers.

• The higher the speed, the less the steering wheel needs to be turned and the sooner it
  must be turned prior to a curve, in order to get the vehicle around the curve.
• Don’t make any sudden movements of the steering wheel.
• It’s safest to drive at the same speed as the other trafﬁc, provided that the other
  trafﬁc is driving at a sensible speed for the conditions and within the speed limit.

Cruise control
On a long trip you can use the cruise control, if your vehicle is so equipped, to keep
your speed constant. Cruise control will save gas and make highway driving less
demanding. However, there are times when you should not use cruise control, such
as in urban areas, on wet or slippery roads, in trafﬁc where the speed is highly variable
or in any situation where your vision is restricted.

Restricted access freeways
A freeway is a multi-lane, divided highway, with restricted access. There should be no
cyclists, pedestrians or hitchhikers. Regina’s Ring Road and Saskatoon’s Circle Drive
are some examples of freeways.

Entering a freeway
The key to entering a freeway is to increase your speed in the acceleration lane until it
matches the speed of the vehicles already on the freeway.

You also need to plan your merge:
1. While on the entrance ramp, look at the freeway trafﬁc and determine where you
   want to merge.
2. Build up your speed in the acceleration lane as quickly as you can.
3. Continue to check the spot where you want to merge.
4. Signal, make your ﬁnal shoulder check and accelerate into the freeway lane.
    Merging at less than freeway speeds can be dangerous.




While on the freeway
Provide a safe merge for other vehicles entering the freeway from access ramps
by either moving left to free the right lane or by adjusting your speed. Drive in the
right lane, or perhaps the centre lane, when there are three lanes. The left lane is for
passing or may be used by faster vehicles when the trafﬁc is dense.

    Keep looking up and referencing down to 12 seconds ahead so that you have
    advance notice of any obstacles in your path. Maintain a three-second following
    distance and keep at least two gates open at all times. When driving conditions are
    not ideal, you should decrease your speed on the freeway accordingly to maintain
    safe travel.

    Leaving a freeway
    When leaving a freeway, signal your intention and move into the deceleration lane.
    Slow down in the deceleration lane, not on the freeway. Some deceleration lanes are
    shorter than others, so watch your speed. When you exit a freeway, you are likely to
    under-estimate your speed when you slow down.




    If you miss an exit
    If you miss an exit, don’t stop on the freeway. Don’t back up on the freeway. Continue
    to the next interchange and return to the correct exit.

    Emergencies on the freeway
    If your vehicle starts to give you trouble, check your mirrors, signal, shoulder check
    and pull over onto the nearest shoulder as quickly and safely as possible. Slow down,
    turn on your hazard lights and stop on the shoulder as far right as possible.

    Never stop your car on the travelled portion of the freeway. Don’t wait for your car to
    stall on the freeway. At the ﬁrst sign of trouble, pull over safely. If possible, stay with
    your car. If you must cross the freeway on foot, use extreme caution.

    Turn on your four-way ﬂashers or raise the hood to alert other motorists you need
    assistance. Be especially careful getting out of your car when stopped along a
    freeway. If necessary, exit from the door away from the trafﬁc.

    In some cities, you may encounter roadways that have some characteristics of a
    freeway and some characteristics of a normal street. Be alert for unexpected trafﬁc
    patterns.

6.4 Passing
Estimation of safe passing time
Using time to estimate when you can pass is complicated, but it’s well worth the effort
required to master it. You can practise passing safely and once you can judge time
well, you have a good method of judging when it’s safe to pass.

You can get all the information you need to make a passing judgment from two
estimates: the estimate of your safe passing time and the estimate of the closing time
between you and the approaching vehicle.

The ﬁrst step in developing your new technique is to ﬁnd out how long it normally
takes you to pass. This varies from 10 to 40 seconds depending on your vehicle, your
technique and the difference in speed between you and the vehicle you are passing.
To ﬁnd your safe passing time, choose a divided highway or a two-way highway at a
time and place when trafﬁc is light.

First, determine your passing time as follows:
1. Follow the vehicle ahead at the same speed, but three seconds back. Note its speed.
2. Check that you can see at least 40 seconds ahead, that there are no vehicles
   coming the other way and that there are no intersections or solid lane markings.
3. Begin counting “Thou - sand one, Thou - sand two” from the point you decide to
   pass and begin to accelerate.
4. Signal, and at a point where you still have good vision and can smoothly change
   lanes around the vehicle ahead, move into the left lane.
5. Continue in the left lane until you see the vehicle you have just passed in your
   inside mirror. As you pull back into your original lane, signal right and continue your
   acceleration. Do not decelerate as you change lanes.
6. Continue counting until you have completed your pass. Stop your count when your
   left rear wheel crosses the lane line (just as you are returning to your original lane in
   front of the vehicle you have passed).
7. The last number you say after “Thou - sand” is your measure of passing time in seconds.

Next, build in a safety margin that you are comfortable with.

Five seconds is a minimum safety margin. For example, if your passing time is 15
seconds, add another ﬁve seconds for possible error. This will give you a cushion of
ﬁve seconds if the vehicle coming towards you is approaching faster than normal or if
your estimation is not accurate.




   Start counting                     Safe passing time                      Stop counting




                                           119
 6     Advanced driving skills
      6.4 Passing



    Your passing time + your safety margin = your safe passing time
    Your safe passing time in this case is 20 seconds.

    If you think about it, your safe passing time will also tell you the minimum sight
    distance needed for safe passing, even if there is nothing coming the other way.

    Try this several times at highway speeds varying the difference between you and the
    vehicle ahead until you get a handle on what your safe passing time actually is.

    Estimation of the closing time of two vehicles
    This is similar to judging the time from ﬁxed objects except now you have a vehicle
    coming towards you. The gap between you and the approaching vehicle will close
    about twice as fast as if you were approaching a ﬁxed object.

    Steps to estimate closing time:
    1. Position your vehicle three seconds behind the vehicle in front.
    2. Determine the point at which you could safely return to your lane if you were to
       pass the vehicle in front – the safe return point. For example, watch a vehicle pass
       and note where it pulls back into the driving lane.
    3. When an approaching vehicle appears, start counting and continue counting until
       the vehicle reaches the safe return point ahead of you. The last number you say
       after “Thou - sand” is your measure of closing time.




                        Safe return point                     Closing time


    The safe/unsafe judgment
    When you feel conﬁdent that you can estimate closing times reasonably well, practise
    judging when it is safe to pass, then check by counting time. When a vehicle is
    approaching, decide if it is safe to pass or not. Say “safe” or “unsafe,” then count
    “Thou - sand one, Thou - sand two” – check the actual closing time against your safe
    passing time to see if you were right. Keep practising until you can make the safe/
    unsafe judgment with 100% accuracy.

    There are two advantages to practising your passing judgment in this way. First, it is
    completely safe because you never actually pass the vehicle. Second, your timing will
    be based on the actual speeds of vehicles using the highway.

    Be sure to keep the type and size of vehicle you are passing in mind. For instance,
    when passing a motorcycle make sure you leave a greater distance between your
    vehicle and the motorcycle you are passing, before pulling back into the driving lane.
    It’s easy to underestimate how much room you should allow due to the smaller size of
    a motorcycle.

The actual passing judgment
Now practise what you have learned. When you judge that it is safe to pass, carry out
a passing manoeuvre.

Remember:
1. You have to build a minimum of a ﬁve-second safety cushion into your safe passing
   time. Do not give this up under any circumstance.
2. When you have enough experience with this method of estimation to be skilled and
   comfortable with it, extend your range. Determine the safe passing time for different
   situations, such as different speeds, surface conditions and longer vehicles such as
   tractor trailers. The passing time will vary.
3. Your safe passing time is also a measure of the shortest sight distance you need to
   pass, even with no oncoming trafﬁc.
4. Your passing time will vary with the speed difference between you and the vehicle
   you are passing.

Being passed
When you’re being passed:
1.   Maintain your speed; do not speed up.
2.   Slow down, move to the right of your lane and let them back into the lane.
3.   If the driver passing you has misjudged, slow down and let them back into the lane.
4.   When being passed by large trucks, you’re likely to be pushed around by the wind.
     Just look where you want to go and your steering will take care of itself.

      6.5 Curves and corners



    6.5 Curves and corners
    The techniques for driving around curves and corners are basically the same. In a
    curve or corner, the vehicle will want to go straight ahead while you want to turn. If
    you’re going too fast, or if the road is slippery, the vehicle will win and you won’t get
    around the corner or curve. Any speed or steering adjustments required while in the
    curve should be very gradual to avoid losing control of your vehicle.

    The most important part of driving a curve or corner is to slow down before you get to it.

    To drive around a sharp curve or corner, follow this procedure:
    1. Slow down. Take your foot off the accelerator and, if necessary, brake. It’s important
       to brake in a straight line.
    2. In a manual transmission vehicle, shift to a lower gear so that you have enough
       power to accelerate through the curve or corner.
    3. Use the vision techniques on page 90.
    4. Use your accelerator gently until you reach the mid-point of the curve, pushing down
       on the accelerator if you want the vehicle to go to the outside of the curve. Ease up on
       the accelerator if you want the vehicle to go to the inside of the curve or corner.
    5. Once you reach the mid-point of the curve, unwind the steering wheel and
       accelerate out of the curve.

6.6 Driving in mountains
When driving in mountains, you will have shorter sight distances, so it’s important that
you look up, reference down and adjust your speed so that you can see at least 12
seconds ahead.

When you drive down mountains, you sometimes move faster than you wish. You’ll
ﬁnd that shifting to a lower gear will help you to slow down. As you travel down the
mountain, brake very lightly and continuously. This method of braking is least likely to
overheat your brakes.


6.7 Grid, municipal and resource access roads
Saskatchewan has a large network of roads connecting its main highways.

These roads present driving challenges which differ from provincial highways. Sight
distances may be shorter. There are no shoulders, curves are sharper and there are many
T-intersections, which means that the road comes to an end, often with little notice.

Unlike main highways, these roads are not designed to help you to get out of trouble
if you happen to be travelling faster than the posted speed limit. The speed limits are
to be taken seriously and should be regarded as maximums under ideal conditions.
When there is no posted speed limit, the speed limit is 80 km/h under ideal
conditions.

Gravel surfaces may cause problems. At times, the gravel may be deep and loose,
making it difﬁcult to steer around curves. At other times there may be so little gravel
that you’re actually driving in dirt, which is very slippery when wet.

When dry, gravel surfaces also create visibility problems. Every moving vehicle creates
clouds of dust that make meeting and passing other vehicles very dangerous.

Railway crossings, crossroads and farm entrances are more difﬁcult to see on these
roads than when you’re driving on provincial highways that provide better sight
distances. You’re also more likely to encounter slow-moving farm vehicles, livestock
and wildlife.

Driving techniques for gravel roads
Drive at a speed suited to the conditions. This means drive slowly. When you exit from
a provincial highway, slow down. Keep your eyes up. You need all the advance notice
you can get. Even though the main path on gravel is often in the centre of the road,
it’s important to stay to the right of centre when approaching and navigating hills and
blind curves to allow room for oncoming vehicles that you cannot see.

To steer in deep gravel, grasp the wheel ﬁrmly. Expect that the vehicle will wander.
You won’t steer as precisely as you do on pavement, so don’t ﬁght it by turning the
steering wheel too much – you could lose control.

Stay well back from dust clouds.

Always drive with your headlights on so that others can see you earlier than they
otherwise might.

      6.8 Winter driving



    When meeting large trucks or farm equipment, slow down and pull as far to the right
    as possible. You may have to stop.


    6.8 Winter driving
    In Saskatchewan, it’s possible that you
    could be operating your vehicle for at
    least ﬁve months of the year in winter
    driving conditions. It’s in this period,
    from November to March, that most
    collisions occur.

    Snow, ice and freezing rain reduce
    traction. Drifting and blowing snow,
    fog, whiteouts, gas exhaust clouds and
    frosted windows may severely limit
    visibility.

    The main cause of collisions in winter
    months is failing to adjust to changing
    conditions.
    Before heading out, be sure to check the Highway Hotline at hotline.gov.sk.ca/map for
    road conditions, and stay home if it says travel not recommended.

    Preparing your vehicle
    Winter conditions, plus the effects of extremely low temperatures, demand that a
    vehicle be in top condition. For this reason, a pre-winter check is a necessity, and
    in the end is less annoying and less costly than battery boosts, tows and being late.
    Give special attention to your heater and defroster.

    As well as getting a tune-up and adding antifreeze to your radiator, you would be wise
    to have the following:
    • snow tires
    • block heater
    • snow brush and scraper
    • gas line antifreeze
    • small snow shovel
    • set of traction mats
    • booster cables (know how to use them)

    For out of town trips, add the following survival equipment:
    • extra warm clothes (include footwear, mitts and hats)
    • a supply of candles and matches
    • tow chain or rope
    • nourishing freezable food (raisins, nuts, candy)
    • sleeping bags
    • cellphone and charger cable

Preparing to see and to be seen
If you cannot see through your windows, you should not drive. If your lights and
signals are to protect you, they must be visible. Before you drive, do the following:
• brush the snow off your car.
• scrape the windshield, rear and side windows.
• clear your heater air intake (this is usually in front of the windshield).
• clean your headlights, tail lights and signal lights.
• be sure to clear your tissue boxes, sunglasses, papers, etc., away from defroster
  outlets.
• drive with your headlights on at all times. Even on a clear day, swirling snow makes it
  difﬁcult to see and to be seen.

Driving on slippery surfaces
Winter traction problems require a number of changes from summer driving
techniques. The general rule for driving on slippery conditions is drive slowly.

You should not use cruise control on icy or slippery roads. This is even more important
when the road may have black ice formed on it (a thin layer of transparent ice found
on the road or other paved surfaces).

Traction varies tremendously with temperature changes. Icy roads will look just the
same at -2 C or -22 C, but will be far more slippery at the warmer temperature.
Winter driving calls for special driving skills. This means gentle acceleration, gentle
braking and small, smooth steering movements.

Reduced traction means the grip between your tires and the slippery surface is
fragile.

If you accelerate hard, you go beyond the amount of traction that is available and
your wheels spin. If you brake too hard and your wheels lock, you break the traction,
which means that when you turn the steering wheel, the vehicle will not turn – it
will continue in the direction it was going when the wheels locked. If this occurs
on ice, your stopping distance changes. In most situations, locking four wheels by
pushing hard on the brakes will give you the shortest stopping distance. But on ice,
especially when it’s near the freezing point or if you are driving fast, you are better off
to threshold-brake by pushing on the brake up to the point just before it locks. (See
“Threshold braking,” page 129.)

If the surface is slippery, ﬂatten the corner or curve by positioning your vehicle in the
left side of your lane prior to making your turn.

As you enter the curve, gradually steer across the lane so that as you near the mid-
point of the curve the vehicle is near the right side of the lane with its wheels straight.
As you exit the curve, gradually steer back across the lane towards the left side. For
left curves, reverse the process. This will lessen the sideways force and reduce the
chance that you will spin out. Slow entry into the curve is crucial or your vehicle may
not make it around the curve.

    Because there is reduced traction available for stopping and turning, reduce your
    speed when conditions are wet or slippery. As well, give yourself a following distance
    even longer than three seconds.




    Never use cruise control when roads are wet or slippery.

How to get moving
You can usually start moving on ice or packed snow by accelerating gently. If this
does not work, or if you are on a slight downgrade, try moving in second gear.

If you’re stuck in deep snow, try rocking your vehicle. To do this, start forward, gently
accelerate and you will move forward a little. When your wheels spin, immediately
stop accelerating and hold the vehicle with the brake to stop it from rolling back.
Shift to reverse, release the brake and accelerate gently. You will move back. When
the wheels spin again, stop immediately. Repeat the forward-backward rocking
movement, increasing the distance you move each time until you gain sufﬁcient
momentum to keep moving ahead. Be sure the wheels have stopped turning before
changing gears to avoid damage to your transmission.

Search for traction. Look for sand or grit. Choose snow rather than ice. A small
movement to one side will often move you from a low traction icy patch onto snow or
sand. This motion can usually be completed in your lane.

How to stop on slippery surfaces
1. Shift to neutral (or declutch) before you brake.
2. Brake early and gently using the threshold technique. (See “Threshold braking,”
   page 129.)
3. Again, search for the best traction and position your vehicle to take advantage of it.
4. Allow extra space for other drivers to stop. They may not be as skilled as you, or
   their traction may be worse.

Temptations to resist
1. Accelerating hard when you are passing.
2. Using cruise control on wet or slippery roads.
3. Forgetting that other drivers may not be making proper allowances for winter
   conditions.
4. Letting your gas tank drop below half full.

Whiteouts
Whiteouts occur when the sky, horizon and ground blend into one, making it
very difﬁcult to determine your position on the road. All shadows and distinctions
disappear, so that you can barely tell where the road ends and the ditch begins.

The ﬁrst snowfalls
During the ﬁrst few snowfalls, drive very slowly and keep a ﬁve-second following
distance. It takes time to change from your summer driving patterns. Exaggerate your
gentleness on your brake and accelerator pedals and you will stay out of the line-ups
at the body shop.

    Survival
    Lives continue to be lost in Saskatchewan winter blizzards.

    Dress warmly for long trips. Do not be deceived by the false comfort of a well-heated
    car and wear indoor clothes on long journeys.

    Before starting a long trip, listen to weather forecasts and pay attention to storm
    warnings. If storms develop while you’re travelling, seriously consider stopping over in
    a town or village, rather than continuing, when there is a possibility of being stranded.

    If you are stranded:
    1. Always stay with your vehicle.
    2. Keep calm.
    3. Lower your downwind-side windows slightly and open the heater air vent to get
       fresh air into the vehicle.
    4. Run the engine to get some heat, and to listen to news reports or charge your
       cellphone but don’t run out of gas or drain your battery.
    5. Keep your exhaust pipe clear of ice and snow.
    6. Get into your emergency clothing before you get cold.
    7. If necessary, use candles to keep warm. Be careful not to over-exert yourself by
       shovelling or by pushing your vehicle.

    Many people die when they leave their vehicles to walk for help in a blizzard. If you
    stay with your vehicle, you have a better chance of surviving and are more likely to be
    found.


    6.9 Braking
    The general procedure for braking is to begin early, apply light pressure and ease up
    on the brake as the vehicle comes to a stop. Always brake with your right foot.

    If you want to stop more quickly, push the brake down a little further. Remember, for
    normal braking you control the stop by varying the pressure. Do not push the brake
    down as far as it will go.

    Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) – was introduced in the mid-1980s and has become
    standard equipment on most newer vehicles. It was designed to help drivers maintain
    some steering ability and avoid skidding while braking. In normal braking, ABS is not
    activated. During hard braking, vehicles with ABS remain stable. The brakes do not
    lock up, which means the driver has more steering control. How do you use ABS?
    Press the brake ﬁrmly and do not release until the vehicle has stopped. Do not pump
    your brakes; the ABS is doing it for you.

    When the ABS is active, the brake pedal may pulsate and the car may shudder or
    emit clunking noises. This can startle some drivers, causing them to release the brake,
    but these things are normal and indicate the ABS is functioning properly.

You may think that with ABS you can stop on a dime. This instantaneous stop is not
realistic. When braking on dry or wet roads your stopping distance will be about the
same as with conventional brakes.

You should allow for a longer stopping distance with ABS than with conventional
brakes when driving on gravel, slush and snow. This is because the rotating tire will
stay on top of this low-traction road surface covering and effectively “ﬂoat” on this
layer.

A non-ABS-braked vehicle can lock its tires and create a snow plow effect in front
of the tires that may, in some cases, help slow the vehicle. These locked tires can
sometimes ﬁnd more traction below this layer. It’s recommended you refer to your
vehicle owner’s manual to become familiar with proper practices should your vehicle
have electronic stability control, traction control, or other safety features.

Threshold braking
In threshold braking, you’re trying to use all the braking force available without locking
the wheels, i.e., you’re trying for the “threshold” just before lock-up.
To accomplish this, shift to neutral (declutch) and brake until you feel one or more
wheels lock, then, ease up the brake slightly until the wheels are all rolling again.
Re-apply pressure until you feel one of the wheels start to lock up, ease off slightly
and continue this movement, tracking the threshold until you stop. As the vehicle
slows, you can brake harder before lock-up will occur.

The more slippery the surface, the less you will be able to push the brake before a
wheel locks.

The skill in threshold braking comes from being able to linger just short of lock-up.
To threshold brake well requires much effort and concentration. While it’s usually the
technique of choice, it is almost impossible to do if you panic.

Four-wheel lock braking
With this technique, you shift to neutral (declutch) and then hit the brakes very hard
so that all four wheels lock at the same time. Since most cars aren’t designed to do
this, you need to stomp on the brake pedal and keep maximum pressure on the brake
until you come to a complete stop.

Your vehicle will travel in a straight line. If all four wheels do not lock at exactly the
same time, or if the surface under different tires varies, the vehicle may rotate a little
before it ﬁnally stops. Even under the worst conditions (one wheel on ice, one wheel
on dry pavement), the vehicle will travel in a straight line, although it may revolve
around a point in the middle of the vehicle.

You need very little pressure to lock the wheels on ice. As the traction increases, you
must increase the pressure to lock the wheels. On dry pavement, you really have to
stomp on the brake to lock all four wheels simultaneously. You must also be seated
sufﬁciently close to the brake pedal to get the leverage required.

    The four-wheel lock will produce the shortest stopping distance on all surfaces,
    except glare ice. It’s also an ideal technique to use if you panic because stomping on
    the brake is a natural reaction. Also, once you stamp on the brake, you do not have to
    do anything except keep pressure on the brake.

    If possible, try the four-wheel lock when you are with a trained instructor. Otherwise,
    practise at low speeds (20 - 40 km/h) on a wet surface. If you try this procedure on
    dry pavement, you may damage your tires, which is acceptable if you’re trying to avoid
    a crash, but not recommended if you are just practising.


    6.10 Emergency driving
    If you use the proper search patterns and see things well in advance, you should
    avoid most emergencies. However, as part of your IPDE method of driving, expect
    that other drivers may sometimes proceed when they shouldn’t. This means that you
    will have to execute your decision in a hurry if you are to avoid a collision.

    In this section, you’ll deal with the techniques you need to control your vehicle
    during the execution part of an emergency situation. To become skilled in emergency
    techniques, you need to practise, if possible, with a trained instructor.

    Where to look
    The rule is simple! Look where you want to go and steer there. Don’t look at the tree
    you want to avoid, look at the gap you want to get through.

    Emergency braking techniques
    Always try to brake in a straight line. Get your wheels straight and line up your vehicle
    so that it can go straight ahead while you’re braking. Don’t try to brake when your
    vehicle is turned – you could spin out. (See “Braking,” page 128.)

    Emergency steering techniques
    The difference between steering in an emergency situation and steering in a normal
    driving situation is the speed and amount that you need to turn the wheel.

    If you do skid and need to recover, turn the wheel to correct your direction of travel.
    This method just takes practise. The difﬁcult part is knowing when your wheels are
    straight.

    At higher speeds, use the “9 and 3” steering method. (See “Hand positions,”
    page 104.) Twist the wheel without moving your hands on the wheel. When your
    hands return to “9” and “3,” you know your front wheels are straight.

Steering around an object involves
three movements:
Steer
Twist the wheel in the direction you
wish to go.

Counter-steer
Turn the wheel back the other way
beyond the centrepoint.

Straighten out
Twist the wheel back to the point
where your wheels are straight.

Timing is crucial, so it’s advisable
to practise this manoeuvre with an
experienced instructor.

It’s important, after turning around
an obstacle, to get the vehicle going
straight before you begin a second
steering movement.

If your choice is between braking
or steering, choose to steer. You
can steer around an obstacle in a
shorter distance than it takes to stop
in front of it.

    Combined braking and steering
    Where you have a choice, the best method of dealing with an emergency is to
    combine braking and steering. Brake ﬁrst, while you slow down and regain control
    and ﬁnish deciding where you want to go.

    If you have time and you are feeling calm, threshold brake. If not, lock your four
    wheels. Regardless of the method of braking you use, take your foot off the brake to
    steer around the object. Most importantly, do one thing at a time, either brake or steer.
    If your wheels are locked, the car will go straight ahead regardless of how you turn the
    steering wheel.




                     Brake     Off brake      Steer

    If you are driving a vehicle equipped with ABS, the best way to deal with an
    emergency is to brake hard and steer where you want to go.


    Neutral/declutch
    Providing it’s recommended for your vehicle type, it’s best to shift to neutral, or
    declutch, in all emergencies, except when you plan to use the accelerator to get
    out of trouble. Please refer to your vehicle owner’s manual for manufacturer’s
    recommendations in this regard.

    Skidding
    A skid usually occurs on a slippery surface when there is not enough traction to
    keep the tires rolling. You will go into a skid when it is wet or slippery if you brake or
    accelerate too hard or turn too sharply.

    Regardless of the kind of skid, always shift to neutral (declutch). Turning the wheel in
    the direction of the skid is correct, but complicated. A much simpler way to decide
    what way to steer is to look where you want to go and steer there.

    Never use cruise control when roads are wet or slippery or on gravel.

    Skids resulting from braking
    The remedy is the same in any skid resulting from braking, regardless of how many
    wheels lock. Shift to neutral (declutch) and remove your foot from the brake. Look where
    you want to go and steer there. By shifting to neutral, you will ensure that the skid does
    not get worse and you will get the wheels rolling again so that you can steer.

    You will probably have to correct the steering. Look where you want to go and steer
    there. This will usually mean steering, counter-steering and straightening out.

Skids resulting from too much acceleration
Sometimes too much acceleration or using cruise control on a slippery surface will
cause the vehicle to skid. To correct this situation, shift to neutral (declutch), take your
foot off the accelerator, look where you want to go and steer there. Do not touch the
brake. Some corrective steering may be necessary.

Skids resulting from steering too sharply
If you turn the wheel too far to the left or right on a slippery surface, the front wheels
will skid straight ahead. To correct this, you must shift to neutral (declutch) and turn the
wheel back towards the centre. As the wheels move to a position where they are turned
less sharply, they will begin to grip again and you will be able to steer. You actually turn
the wheel in the opposite direction from which you wish to go until the wheels begin to
roll. Only at this point do you look where you want to go and steer there.




When in a skid, look where you want to go and steer there.


When skids go too far
Sometimes, when a skid has gone too far, the vehicle will start to spin. You may not be
able to stop the spinning, but you do have a choice of where it spins. Shift to neutral, if
you have time, and lock all four wheels. The vehicle will spin in a straight line, continuing
in the direction in which it was last going. Usually, if you do this you can stay on the road.

To avoid getting into skids
To avoid getting into a skid, ﬁrst adjust your speed to the conditions, then look well
ahead so that you have plenty of time to react slowly and smoothly. If you must make
any movements on a slippery surface, make them smoothly and gently and avoid
sudden movements of the steering wheel.

Do not turn a little problem into a tragedy
Many collisions are caused by the driver’s over-reaction to a possible emergency
situation. If you ﬁnd yourself in an emergency situation, try to remain calm and take the
time to think before you act. As a skid develops, the earlier you take action, the smaller
the corrective movement required and the greater are your chances of controlling it.

      6.10 Emergency driving



    Drifting onto a soft shoulder
    If you drift onto a soft shoulder, it’s not what you do that is important, it is what you do
    not do that counts.

    If your right wheels drop onto a soft shoulder, don’t jerk the wheel to get back on the
    road in a hurry and don’t brake hard.

    Do not take any corrective action immediately, just steer straight along the shoulder,
    gradually slowing down. Then, when you have slowed and there are no other vehicles
    around, turn the wheel left and almost immediately (when you feel your front wheel
    come onto the road) counter-steer and straighten out.




    It’s a simple procedure as long as you don’t steer very much. You should, however,
    grip the wheel tightly.

    If you come off in a critical location, for example, just before a bridge, then treat your
    return to the road like an emergency lane change and steer, counter-steer, straighten.

    Ditches
    With ditches, as with soft shoulders, it’s what you don’t do that’s important.

    Don’t brake hard, don’t turn the wheel violently and don’t try to get back on the road.
    These actions are very likely to cause your vehicle to roll over.

    The important thing is to drive down the ditch. The greater the slope of the ditch, the
    more you will have to steer down the ditch to keep from rolling.

    To drive down the ditch, hold the wheel ﬁrmly. Look and steer gently down the slope
    to where you want to go. Stay off the brake. Gradually release the accelerator. If
    you need to steer to avoid an obstacle, do it slowly and gradually and, if you have a
    choice, choose the direction that will send you down the slope.

    If you suddenly ﬁnd yourself going into a ditch, do not over-react. Try to resist doing
    anything until you think about what you must do. You’re better off to do nothing than
    to try the wrong thing.

Gentle ditch                                   Steep ditch

It’s perfectly all right to drive in a ditch to avoid a rollover, provided you don’t hit an
approach road or something hard. The main cause of rollovers is attempting to return
to the road too early. You may have to be towed out, but that is a small price to pay
compared to rolling the car.

Blow-outs
With a front or rear tire blow-out, do not over-react. Look where you want to go and
steer there, holding the steering wheel ﬁrmly. Gradually ease off the accelerator and
gently brake. Once you have slowed down, steer the vehicle off to the side of the
road.

Blow-outs can cause tremendous steering and wheel vibration. Do not be alarmed.
Remember, gentle braking will improve stability and reduce steering and wheel
vibration.

Rear wheel blow-outs can cause the back of the car to ﬁshtail. Do not over-correct
your steering. Just brake gently and steer where you want to go. Remember to shift to
neutral (declutch).

Brake failure
Vehicles are manufactured with a two-circuit hydraulic brake system, and total brake
failure is very rare. If one half of the system fails, the brake warning light will usually
come on when you apply the brakes and you’ll have to push much harder to slow or
stop the vehicle. Even if the brake pedal goes right to the ﬂoor, do not give up. It‘ll still
have stopping power.

You can help slow the vehicle by using the parking brake. Try to avoid having the rear
wheels lock as this will cause the vehicle to spin around. By adjusting the parking
brake release, you will make it easier to vary the pressure and avoid locking.

Don’t pump your brakes. It’s the wrong thing to do with a modern brake system. If the
vehicle pulls to one side, grasp the wheel ﬁrmly, counter-steer and shift to a lower
gear. After the car has stopped, do not drive any further. Call for help.

 6     Advanced driving skills
      6.10 Emergency driving



    Power steering or power brake failure
    Most vehicles have some form of power assistance for braking and steering to reduce
    the force necessary to operate the controls.

    If the engine stalls, you’ll lose your power assistance and will have to apply a great
    deal more force to the brake or steering wheel to maintain control. Try shifting to
    neutral and re-starting the engine, then return the shift lever to drive.

    Accelerator sticking
    If your accelerator sticks, don’t panic. Shift to neutral (or declutch), slow down, pull
    over and stop. Then, turn the key off and try unsticking the pedal with your feet.

    Headlight failure
    If your headlights suddenly go out, immediately slow down to keep your original
    course, pull over and stop. Check the headlight switch and the dimmer switch. If
    these don’t work, put on the parking lights or hazard lights.

    Animals on the road
    Peak times
    Wild animals are unpredictable but there
    are times when the risk of a collision is
    particularly high. Be alert during the months
    of May and June when animals are drawn
    to ditches for road salt and to escape biting
    insects. Animals are also especially active
    in the late fall and early winter during mating
    season and migration. The peak times for
    collisions are dawn and dusk.

    Watch your speed
    Yellow wildlife warning signs indicate areas
    of high risk. No matter the season or time
    of day, it’s important to watch for signs of
    wildlife and reduce your speed accordingly.
    Slowing down reduces the distance
    required to stop and decreases the force of
    impact in the event of a collision.

    Be alert
    It’s important to constantly scan the road from shoulder to shoulder. Being alert is still
    your best defence to prevent a collision. When you see an animal at the side of the
    road, slow down and pass by slowly. For night driving, look for the glowing eyes of
    animals and use your high beams whenever possible.

When encountering an animal, try to do the following:
• Remain calm if an animal appears on the road in front of you. If you have time to
  stop, do so at a safe distance and stay alert. When one animal crosses the road,
  others often follow. You can also sound your horn to scare wildlife away from the
  road.
• If an animal appears suddenly and surprises you, remember to brake ﬁrmly and stay
  in control of your vehicle. Avoid swerving because you may turn into oncoming trafﬁc
  or roll into the ditch.
• If the animals are being herded or if you approach horseback riders you should slow
  down and wait for the herder or rider to move the animals across the road or to one
  side and indicate that it’s safe to proceed. Do not use your horn as it may panic or
  scatter the animals.

When a collision is unavoidable
Sometimes collisions with wildlife are unavoidable even if you take every precaution
and remain alert at the wheel. In these circumstances, try to remain calm.
• Aim your vehicle at the spot where the animal came from, not where it’s going.
• Try for a glancing blow rather than a head-on encounter and let up on your brake just
  before you collide. This causes the front of your vehicle to rise slightly and reduces
  the chances of the animal going through your windshield.
• Hitting an animal can be a traumatic experience. If possible, move to the shoulder
  and turn on your hazard lights. Take a moment to regain your composure and then
  assess the damage to your vehicle.
• Don’t approach the animal, especially if it appears to be wounded. Injured animals
  can be dangerous.
• Call the police or your local RCMP detachment if there are human injuries or
  signiﬁcant damage to your vehicle. If the damage is less severe, you may continue
  driving and follow regular SGI claims reporting procedures.
• Call the Conservation Ofﬁcer Service if there is a dead or injured animal to report.

    6.11 Understanding collisions
    When you know your front steps are icy, you take special care when going down
    them. By being aware of and understanding some basic trafﬁc collision statistics,
    you’ll know to take special care to avoid high-risk situations.

    Two-thirds of the time, the causes of collisions are related to driver condition or
    improper action.

    Some of the most common contributing factors to collisions are:
    • driver inattention
    • failing to yield the right of way
    • driving too fast for road conditions
    • driving under the inﬂuence of alcohol or drugs
    • disregarding a trafﬁc control device
    • driver inexperience or confusion
    • following too closely
    • backing unsafely
    • changing lanes or passing improperly

    Other information you should know about collisions:
    • Most trafﬁc collisions occur during peak trafﬁc times such as late afternoon and early
      evening.
    • November and December usually have the highest total number of collisions.
    • August and October are when the most severe collisions and the most trafﬁc deaths
      occur.
    • Alcohol is a factor in about 4% of all trafﬁc collisions and in about 40% of all fatal
      collisions.
    • Approximately 90% of all collisions in rural Saskatchewan are single-vehicle
      collisions.
    • Wearing a seatbelt can decrease your chances of being killed or seriously injured in
      a collision by as much as 50%.

6.12 What to do if you’re in a collision
The ﬁrst few minutes after a crash can be critical if the consequences are to be
minimized. If you haven’t been seriously injured during the collision, the following
steps should be followed as quickly and calmly as possible.

Protect the scene
If any gasoline has spilled, make sure the ignitions of any damaged vehicles are turned
off and any cigars or cigarettes are extinguished.

Warn approaching trafﬁc by setting up ﬂares (well away from the crash scene)
or delegating two people to signal at each end of the collision scene. Turn on the
hazard lights of all undamaged vehicles at the scene. This is particularly critical during
darkness or at times of reduced visibility when the risk of subsequent collisions is very
high.

Check all injuries
Make an initial survey of damage, checking for hidden victims. Call 9-1-1 and
administer ﬁrst aid to the injured in order of priority. Injured persons should be moved
only if they are in danger of drowning, suffocating, burning or being electrocuted.

If you have not had formal training in ﬁrst aid, follow these tips:
• If the person is unconscious, be sure their air passages are clear. False teeth,
  chewing gum, vomit or mucus can block air passages.
• If the person is not breathing and you’re familiar with mouth-to-mouth or artiﬁcial
  respiration, begin the procedure immediately.
• Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure over the wound. A clean piece of tissue
  or handkerchief may be used. If there is a depressed skull fracture, pressure should
  not be applied.
• If a person is pinned in a car, do not attempt to move them, but be sure the head
  and spine are ﬁrmly supported.
• Reassure the injured individual and stay with them until an ambulance or other
  vehicle is available to take them to the hospital.
• Give all information on the ﬁrst aid that you have applied to the ambulance attendant
  and the police.

Contact the police
All crashes involving injury or death, hit and run, an impaired driver, an out-of-province
vehicle or where a vehicle must be towed from the scene must be immediately
reported to police.

Be prepared to give an accurate description of the crash location, the number of
injured persons, the severity of the injuries and any other support services that may be
required, such as ambulance, ﬁreﬁghting, rescuing or towing. Stay on the phone long
enough to make certain that all the information has been recorded.

 6     Advanced driving skills
      6.12 What to do if you are in a collision



    Check for witnesses
    Record the names of any witnesses to assist the police with their investigation. Keep
    a copy of the names for your insurance company or lawyer in case any legal action
    follows.

    Take photographs
    Take photographs of the collision scene, vehicles involved in the crash and road
    conditions.

    When to provide a report to police
    If asked, you’re required to provide a statement to police if you were a driver,
    passenger or witness.

    If you’re involved in a collision in which there are no injuries or deaths, that does not
    involve a hit and run or an impaired driver, that does not involve an out-of-province
    vehicle and where all vehicles can be driven from the scene of the collision, you must
    provide the vehicle owner with your name, address, driver’s licence number and any
    relevant insurance information.

    Dangerous goods
    If a vehicle involved in the collision is a truck displaying a dangerous goods placard,
    you must take extra care in case the vehicle is discharging a dangerous substance.

    Power lines
    If your vehicle comes in contact with a power line, stay in your vehicle and call
    SaskPower at 306-310-2220. If it’s an emergency, call 9-1-1 and stay in your vehicle
    until help arrives.

    If your vehicle is on ﬁre and you must exit the vehicle:
    1. Make sure there are no wires in your way.
    2. Stand in the doorway of the vehicle with feet together and cross your arms over your
       chest.
    3. Jump as far away from the vehicle as possible and land with both feet together.
    4. Do not touch the vehicle.
    5. Keep arms crossed, feet together, and hop at least 10 metres to safety.

    If you see a collision involving a power pole, fallen line or transformer:
    1. Park at least 10 metres away and assess the situation before getting out of your
        vehicle.
    2. Don’t touch the other vehicle(s), power pole, fallen line or transformer because they
        may be energized.
    3. Call 9-1-1 and provide a detailed description of the scene and the electrical hazard.
    4. Keep yourself and others at least 10 metres away and wait for emergency personnel
        to arrive.

Exchange information with other drivers
As a driver in Saskatchewan, you’re required to provide your name, address, driver’s
licence number and vehicle licence plate number to any other persons involved in a
collision, regardless of the severity. You should also record the licence plate number
of all vehicles involved in the collision. If a non-Saskatchewan vehicle is involved, or if
you are involved in a collision outside Saskatchewan, you’re also required to provide
information on the company that insures your vehicle.

Don’t admit fault or any other liability before discussing the details of the collision with
your insurance adjuster.

Don’t offer to pay for any repairs or accept payment for repairs unless you’re prepared
to handle the matter without the help of your insurance company.

Report to SGI
To report your claim:
• Visit www.sgi.sk.ca and use the SGI Auto eClaim registration service.
• Call the claims centre closest to your home (see the SGI information pages in the
  front of your SaskTel phone book).
• Call 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744).

When you report a claim, you’ll need to have your vehicle appraised and the damage
assessed. You can set up an appointment at an SGI claims centre or your adjuster
may tell you that you can take your vehicle to an SGI-accredited repair ﬁrm to
complete the assessment. To help you avoid delays, please don’t visit a claims centre
for an appraisal without ﬁrst calling the claims centre closest to your home or using
eClaim.

If your vehicle is not driveable, call the claims centre closest to your home to make
arrangements with an adjuster. Your vehicle will be towed to a location where the
damage can be appraised.

To speed up the process when you report your claim, have the following information
on hand: your driver’s licence, the vehicle registration and, if you have one, your auto
extension policy number.

Collisions involving injury, death, hit and run, an impaired driver, vehicles that have to be
towed from the scene or an out-of-province vehicle must also be reported to the police.

An appraiser will assess the damage to
your vehicle and the cost of repairs.
Once the appraisal is done, you will
receive a printout outlining the cost of
repairs if your vehicle is repairable.

Once your adjuster has conﬁrmed your
coverage, you may have the vehicle
repaired at the auto body shop of your
choice. SGI doesn’t direct customers to
any particular repair facility.

6.13 Impairing factors (other than drugs and alcohol)
Fatigue
It’s not wise to drive when you’re tired or sleepy, particularly if you are driving along a
straight road where the chances of falling asleep are high.

An early warning sign of fatigue is noticing you’re not looking as far ahead as you
should, or not moving your eyes in the proper search pattern. Rather, you tend to stare
straight ahead.

What can you do about it?
• Recognize and admit that you’re becoming tired. Some highways have rumble strips
  along the shoulder line and, in a few places, on the centre lines to alert drivers when
  they drift out of their lane.
• Stop and rest.
• Change drivers when you start to feel tired.

If you can’t stay awake, then for your safety and the safety of others, get off the road!

Personal stress and illness
By now, it should be clear to you that
driving places heavy demands on your
ability to think clearly. Emotional and
physical stress – worry, grief, anger, joy,
a toothache, a headache – anything that
is really bothering you, will distract you
from the thinking part of your driving.
If you know you’re under stress, either
emotional or physical, do not drive.
Arrange to be driven by someone else
who is not involved in the emotional
situation and who is physically well.

    Aggressive driving
    Slow moving trafﬁc, a motorist who doesn’t signal, a seemingly endless stream of
    pedestrians – they can all frustrate the average driver. Aggressive driving, more
    commonly known as road rage, occurs when a motorist becomes angry, hostile or
    furious behind the wheel. And it’s not only yelling obscenities or running other drivers
    off the road that are signs of road rage. The slightest variation in driving behaviour, no
    matter how minimal, is still considered road rage.

    To ensure a safe trip, it’s recommended that drivers:
    • don’t take trafﬁc problems personally                   • use your horn sparingly
    • avoid eye contact with an aggressive driver             • don’t block the passing lane
    • don’t make obscene gestures                             • don’t block the right turn lane
    • don’t tailgate

    If you notice someone on the road who is driving aggressively, the best thing you can
    do to ensure your safety is to pull over and let that person pass by you.

    Fog, dust, heavy rain and poor visibility
    These factors may impair your vision:
    • Make sure that your headlights and
      tail lights are on and clean so that
      other people can see you.
    • Adjust your speed to the number of
      seconds you can see ahead. If you
      can’t see 12 seconds ahead, slow
      down until you can.
    • In fog, blowing snow or heavy rain you
      will see better if you drive with your
      lights on low beam.
    • The smear that windshield wipers sometimes create may be removed by using a
      good windshield wiper ﬂuid or a sprinkle of ordinary detergent.
    • If you have already slowed down and still cannot see 12 seconds ahead, ﬁnd a safe
      place as soon as you can and get off the road.

    Be aware that during the ﬁrst 10 minutes of a rain storm, the roads are the most
    slippery. The solution to driving in heavy rain is to slow down, making only small and
    gentle movements with your brake, accelerator and steering wheel.

Cellphones
Many collisions are the result of driver distraction. Many people talk or text on a
cellphone while driving, which can have dangerous consequences. As a result, there
is legislation that prohibits the use of a cellphone without a hands-free headset while
driving.

The following are key tips to remember when using a cellphone in your vehicle to
ensure a safe ride:
• put your cellphone in a place where it won’t tempt you, such as the back seat, or
  switch it off or to airplane mode while you drive
• always use a hands-free unit (experienced drivers only, see page 23)
• become familiar with your phone and its features – before you try to use the hands-
  free unit while driving
• don’t dial while driving – instead, pull off the road
• be a good Samaritan by reporting emergencies and road hazards
• never take notes or look up phone numbers while driving
• avoid stressful or emotional conversations while on the road; you can always pull
  over or end the conversation
• do not use a cellphone when refueling your vehicle
• most importantly, whenever possible, pull over to a safe spot on the roadside to use
  the phone

See Distracted driving page 23.

Cigarette smoke
Open the windows while smoking.
Vehicles with children in them are
non-smoking areas; it’s illegal to smoke
while children are in the vehicle.

Cigarette smoke will gradually cause a
ﬁlm on the inside of your windshield and
windows. If people who smoke use your
vehicle, clean the inside of your windows
with window cleaner as soon as you
notice the start of a build up.

 7     Drinking, drugs and driving
      7.1 Alcohol




    7. Drinking, drugs and driving
    7.1      Alcohol
    Facts about drinking and driving in Saskatchewan*:
    • A drinking driver is involved in four out of every 10 fatal collisions.
    • There is a drinking driver in approximately 6% of all collisions where someone
      is injured.
    • Of the average 34 people killed, 24 were drivers, seven were passengers, two
      were pedestrians.
    • Of the average 34 people killed, 19 were killed on highways, six on rural roads,
      four on urban streets and ﬁve on First Nations roads.
    • Those aged 25-34 are involved in the most alcohol-related collisions.
    • Alcohol, although legal, is an addictive drug that depresses the central nervous
      system (brain) and may change your mood and behaviour.
    * Based on 2018 to 2022 ﬁve-year average.

    The impairing effects of alcohol on the brain
    Alcohol affects everyone differently. Blood alcohol content (BAC) may be affected
    by age, gender, physical condition, and amount of food consumed, medication and
    other factors. Also, different mixed drinks contain different amounts of alcohol, so it’s
    important to know how much alcohol has been consumed, not just how many drinks
    the person has had.

    Sequence of effects on the body
    Alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream very quickly. As blood alcohol levels start to
    rise, the brain becomes increasingly sedated or drugged.

    1. Judgment                                  2.   Muscle control
       The ﬁrst part of the body affected             The second part of the body affected
       by alcohol is the brain, particularly          by alcohol is muscle control. Due to

       noticed by the drinker. The part of the
       brain that controls social inhibitions is
       also affected, causing people to say
       and do things they normally would
       not. These effects start with one drink.

    Many people wrongly assess their ability to drive after drinking by observing physical
    dexterity (staggering, etc.). This is incorrect as the greatest percentage of alcohol-
    related collisions result from faulty thinking during the identiﬁcation, prediction and
    decision parts of the driving task and not as a result of poor execution (steering,
    braking, etc.).

The brain functions that are ﬁrst affected by alcohol consumption are not only
important to our ability to drive safely, but are the same ones required to make rational
decisions about not driving after drinking. For this reason, you must make the decision
to separate your drinking and driving and make the necessary alternate transportation
plans before you have that ﬁrst drink!

It doesn’t make sense to drive after drinking. For more information on the effects of

      7.1 Alcohol



    Likelihood of a crash
    As the concentration of alcohol in the bloodstream increases, the body loses more
    and more of the functions required to drive safely. The increased likelihood of a crash
    begins long before drivers feel drunk or severely impaired.

    It’s important to understand BAC and its impact on driving at various levels. Driving
    impaired, even at low levels, is a real gamble.

    The only truly safe BAC is 0%.

                                     .05-.09% BAC                  .10 -.14% BAC             .15+% BAC

    BAC and time
    Only time can eliminate alcohol from the body. You cannot successfully sleep off a
    night of heavy drinking in a few hours. If you go to bed intoxicated with a BAC of
    .25% and alcohol leaves the system at a rate of approximately .015% per hour, this
    might be a picture of what happens:

7.2      Drugs
Facts about drugs and driving in Saskatchewan*:
• Over 68 collisions involving a drug-impaired driver resulted in more than 38 injuries
  and three deaths.
• Drug-impaired drivers do not react or make decisions as quickly as a sober driver.
  Their attention, judgment, motor skills, balance, and co-ordination are all impacted.
• The combination of alcohol and drugs creates a synergistic effect and signiﬁcantly
  increases impairment levels.
* Based on 2018 - 2022 ﬁve-year average.

Prescription, over-the-counter, and recreational drugs
Many drugs affect your brain functioning and some directly affect your driving.

Cannabis
Some people think that cannabis is a safer
substitute to drinking, but it can cause
concentration to wander, which can affect
reaction times. It can also cause paranoia,
drowsiness, distorted perception and a
sense of disorientation – all of which could
cause you to lose control at the wheel.

Some experts claim that smoking a cannabis joint has roughly a similar level of
impairment on driving ability as drinking four pints of beer. Also, reports show that in
the majority of fatal collisions where cannabis has been detected in a driver’s body,
alcohol has also been detected. Alcohol alone or in combination with cannabis
increases impairment, collision rate and collision responsibility (the same can be
applied to other drugs too).

Depressant drugs
Like alcohol, other depressant drugs include sedatives
or tranquillizers (used to treat anxiety, depression and
sleeping disorders, e.g., valium), antihistamines (often
used in ﬂu, allergy and hay fever remedies) and painkillers.
These drugs slow down your brain and body; they blunt
alertness and reduce motor coordination. This affects a
person’s ability to drive safely in a way similar to alcohol.
Any drug that causes drowsiness can also affect a
person’s ability to drive safely.

 7     Drinking, drugs and driving
      7.2 Drugs



    People who drive after using any type of depressant can’t react as quickly when they
    need to. Their vision is affected, and may be blurred or doubled. Depth perception is
    altered, making it hard to tell whether other vehicles, pedestrians or objects are close
    or far away. Their driving is more likely to be careless or reckless – weaving, speeding,
    driving off the road, and (too often) crashing.

    If the label advises against operating heavy machinery, consider it a warning not to get
    behind the wheel of a vehicle.

    Stimulants
    Stimulant drugs, such as caffeine and amphetamines, may increase alertness, but this
    does not mean they improve driving skills. The tired driver who drinks coffee to stay
    awake on the road should be aware that the stimulant effect can wear off suddenly,
    and that the only remedy for fatigue is to pull off the road and sleep. Amphetamines
    do not seem to affect driving skills when taken at medical doses, but they do make
    some people over-conﬁdent, which can lead to risky driving. Higher doses of
    amphetamines often make people hostile and aggressive.

    If you think drug taking has little, or even a positive impact on your driving, you could
    be tragically mistaken. It’s important to bear in mind that it can be hard to determine
    exactly how a drug will affect your driving ability – impairment caused by drugs can
    vary according to the individual, drug type, dosage, the length of time the drug stays
    in your body, or if the drug has been taken with other drugs or alcohol.

    When taking prescription or over-the-counter medications, it’s wise to consult with

Illegal drugs
Illegal drugs impair your driving. They can alter your perception of time and what you
see. They can make you hallucinate or miss things you should see. They can put you
to sleep.

Cocaine
This is a psycho-stimulant that can lead to misjudging driving speed and stopping
distances. It can also cause a distorted sense of light and sound and a feeling of
overconﬁdence, which can lead to aggressive and erratic driving. While it can make
you feel alert at ﬁrst, the effects wear off quickly, leading to an increased danger of
falling asleep at the wheel.

Ecstasy
A stimulant drug with hallucinogenic properties, ecstasy can distort your sense of
vision and heighten your sense of sound. Your concentration can be affected, while
you may become over-conﬁdent and more likely to take dangerous risks.

Ketamine, LSD and magic mushrooms
Drugs such as these with hallucinogenic properties can strongly inﬂuence the senses,
so drivers may react to objects or sounds that aren’t there and place themselves and
other road users in danger. Coordination skills are likely to be greatly affected, and
you may experience anxiety, blurred vision and a sense of detachment from reality – all
of which could be deadly on the road.

Speed (amphetamine)
While amphetamines might give you a sense of heightened alertness and conﬁdence,
they can be highly dangerous for drivers as they distort your perceptions and can
make you feel anxious, prone to panic attacks and lose coordination.

Drug-impaired driving is considered as serious an offence as alcohol-impaired driving,
and carries the same penalties.

There are no illegal drugs that improve your driving. They all make it worse. Don’t drive
after using any drugs.

      7.3 Drinking and drugs combined



    7.3     Drinking and drugs combined
    Many people think that driver impairment is caused exclusively by ingestion of
    alcohol. The truth is that the alcohol in one’s body will determine their blood alcohol
    level. However, if that person already has another drug in their system, the impairing
    effect on the functioning of the central nervous system (brain) is far greater than the
    impairing effect of the alcohol and the impairing effect of the other drugs combined;
    it’s not a simple adding together of impairment, but rather a multiplier effect!

    This is the synergistic effect! What it means is that the whole is greater than the sum
    of its parts, or 1 + 1 = more than two. When combining drugs and alcohol it causes a
    multiplying effect. This has an unpredictable effect on driving and can be deadly.

    Perhaps a few real life examples would be helpful to understand this synergistic
    effect. Assume that a drink is:
    • 1 bottle of regular alcohol content beer; or
    • 5 ounces table wine; or
    • 3 ounces fortiﬁed wine (port or sherry); or
    • 1-1/2 ounce hard liquor (rye, rum, vodka etc.).

    Combined with:
    • anti-depressants
    • gravol
    • antihistamines
    • valium

 Drinking, drugs and driving
7.3 Drinking and drugs combined
                                                                                           7
We ﬁnd that there is a predictable synergistic effect related to the level of impairment
caused by a certain number of drinks when combined in this manner.

   Number of                                                   Equivalent to Number
                                  Combined With
    Drinks                                                           of Drinks
        2                 Antihistamine (Cold Remedy)              = 4 to 5
        2                         Marijuana (1 joint)              = 5 to 6
        2               Tranquilizer (Valium – normal dose)        = Approximately 6
        2                              Gravol                      = Approximately 6

It must be noted that the dosage of the drug will have a serious effect on the
“equivalence to number of drinks” estimates. Hydroponically grown marijuana, for
example, is much stronger than the light dosage drug used in compiling the ﬁgures for
this chart.

In all cases, the Intoxilyzer reading would indicate just the blood alcohol level caused
by two drinks, but the actual impairment of central nervous system function would be
equivalent to a much higher blood alcohol level.

Understanding the synergistic effect of alcohol combined with other drugs could be a
lifesaver.

Students Against Drinking and Driving (SADD)
SADD is a positive lifestyle promotional program that attempts to make drinking and
driving socially unacceptable among young people and encourages them to help
each other change their attitudes about drinking and driving. With the help of an adult
leader, students develop and promote the program themselves using assemblies,
rallies, classroom sessions and social activities. Parents are encouraged to support
the program by attending SADD functions and entering into a contract with their
teenager whereby each agrees to always seek safe, sober transportation home.

For more information, contact SADD at 306-757-5562.

      8.1 The Trafﬁc Safety Act




    8. Complying with the law when driving
    8.1 TheTrafﬁcSafetyAct
    Cities, towns and some villages have their own set of ‘rules of the road,’ known as
    bylaws. These rules are necessary as each urban centre has special driving situations.
    However, bylaws must complement The Trafﬁc Safety Act, Saskatchewan’s trafﬁc laws.

    Enforcement
    To permit the police to function effectively, they’ve been given certain powers. You’re
    required to comply with the requests or demands of the police when they are carrying
    out their duties.

    Stopping when signalled by police
    Police can signal you to stop using their red/blue lights, a special stop light, voice
    commands or hand signals. You must pull over as close to the right-hand edge of the
    road as possible and stop before entering the next intersection.

    Producing driver’s licence and registration
    If requested, you must show the police your driver’s licence and vehicle registration. If
    you don’t have them with you, the police may allow you up to 48 hours to produce them.

    Unsafe vehicles
    The police may require you to submit your vehicle for a safety inspection. If they ﬁnd
    that your vehicle is unsafe, they can order you to take it off the road and to not drive it
    until it has been repaired.

    Vehicle impoundments
    If a vehicle is being operated in violation of trafﬁc laws, or presents a hazard by being
    parked within the traveled portion of a roadway, it may be impounded by police under
    the SGI Vehicle Impoundment Program.

    Impoundments are based on the actions of the driver. Any vehicle can be impounded,
    including passenger vehicles, trucks and commercial vehicles.

    There are three types of impoundments:
    1. Impaired driving impoundments - Includes both drug and alcohol impairment.
    2. Unauthorized driver impoundments - Includes driving while suspended or without
       a valid driver’s licence. The vehicle will be impounded for 30 days, if it’s the driver’s
       second occurrence in a two-year period the impound length is 60 days.
    3. Rules of the road impoundments - Vehicles will be seized when drivers commit
       certain high-risk offences. These offences contribute to unsafe roads and impact
       the severity of collisions. Anyone stopped by law enforcement who is being
       charged with an offence, meeting the criteria outlined in the chart on page 155
       will have the vehicle they are driving impounded for the following impoundment
       terms.

The vehicle will be impounded even if you’re not the owner. All towing and storage
costs are the responsibility of the vehicle owner. The owner of the impounded vehicle
may recover from a driver, in any manner authorized by law, any amount the owner has
paid to recover their motor vehicle.

An application to the Highway Trafﬁc Board can be made to have a vehicle released
early from impoundment in certain limited circumstances. If your vehicle was stolen
at the time of the impoundment, please contact SGI at 1-844-855-2744 with your
police ﬁle number as soon as possible.

Impaired driving
Drivers who are impaired by alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both may be subject
to severe consequences. Consequences apply even if the driver is not found
criminally impaired, but exceeded the provincial limits.

If a driver is found to have exceeded the provincial limit, the severity of the
consequences are determined based on how many administrative suspensions have
been issued in the past 10 years, and whether they are considered a new driver or an
experienced driver.

If a driver is found to be criminally impaired, the consequences are more severe, and
apply to all drivers.

    New driver roadside administrative licence suspensions
    New drivers caught with any detectable amount of alcohol or drugs will be suspended
    at roadside and face other consequences such as vehicle impoundment and
    mandatory ignition interlock.

    There is zero tolerance for alcohol for new drivers, and zero tolerance for drugs for
    both new and experienced drivers.

    New drivers are:
    • 21 years of age and under
    • Learner (Class 7)
    • Class 5 Novice 1 and Novice 2
    • Endorsement 6, M1, or M2 (while operating a motorcycle)
    • No licence in the last ﬁve years
    • Out of Country drivers (when equivalent Class cannot be determined)
    • Restricted or Provisional drivers

    New drivers who receive roadside suspensions and who are transporting passengers
    under 16 will receive an increased vehicle impoundment length. The chart below

Indeﬁnite roadside administrative licence suspensions
If you’re charged with a criminal impaired driving offence you lose your licence
immediately and face other consequences like vehicle impoundment. The immediate
roadside licence suspension is indeﬁnite and remains in effect until your charges
are resolved in court. You may be eligible to reinstate your driving privileges early by
voluntarily installing an alcohol-sensing ignition interlock device in your vehicle. To be
eligible, your charge must be alcohol-related and you must serve at least 90 days of
your indeﬁnite suspension.

The chart on page 155 outlines the consequences for drivers who are convicted of a
criminal impaired driving offence.

      8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada



    8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada
    Certain driving behaviours are dealt with more severely or are considered to be sufﬁciently
    dangerous or objectionable to be dealt with under the Criminal Code of Canada.

    The penalties and consequences for criminal driving offences are severe. In addition
    to the penalties under the Criminal Code, there are also provincial penalties. Under
    the provincial legislation the consequences include suspensions, reinstatement
    programs and ﬁnancial penalties.

    Some examples of Criminal Code driving offences are:

    Impaired Driving Offences
    Equal to or exceeds .08 BAC
    It’s an offence to drive or to operate a conveyance* when you have over 80 mg or
    more of alcohol per 100 ml of blood (or .08% per 100 ml). If your blood alcohol
    content (BAC) is over .08 you have committed a Criminal Code offence.

    Impaired
    Operating a conveyance while your ability to operate is impaired in any degree by
    alcohol or a drug or by a combination of alcohol and a drug is an offence.

    * Deﬁned as a motor vehicle, water vessel, aircraft or railway equipment.

    Exceeds drug
    It’s an offence to operate a conveyance when you have a blood drug concentration
    that is equal to or exceeds the blood drug concentration prescribed by federal
    regulation for that drug.

    Combination alcohol and drug
    It’s an offence to operate a conveyance if you have a blood alcohol concentration and
    a blood drug concentration that is equal to or exceeds the blood alcohol and blood
    drug concentration prescribed by regulation for instances where alcohol and that
    drug are combined.

    Operation – low blood drug concentration
    It’s an offence to operate a conveyance if you have a blood drug concentration that
    is equal to or exceeds the blood drug concentration that is prescribed by federal
    regulation for that drug and is less than the concentration prescribed for Exceeds Drug.

    Mandatory Alcohol Screening
    A police ofﬁcer may demand a breath sample from a driver in the absence of having a
    reasonable suspicion that the driver has consumed alcohol.

    Refusal
    If a police ofﬁcer suspects you are impaired they may demand that you provide a
    breath sample or samples of a bodily substance that, in the police ofﬁcer’s opinion,

8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada
                                                                                                              8
are necessary to enable a proper analysis by means of an approved screening device
or approved drug screening equipment. The police ofﬁcer may also demand that you
immediately perform physical coordination tests.

Knowing that a demand has been made for a sample, it’s an offence to fail or refuse to
comply without reasonable excuse.

Refusing to comply with a demand is an offence.

Administrative Consequences for Criminal Code Impaired Driving Offences
An indeﬁnite licence suspension will be issued to any driver who is charged
under the Criminal Code of Canada with an impaired driving related offence. The
suspension will remain in effect until the charges are resolved in court. If the offence
you are charged with is alcohol-related, you may be eligible to reinstate your driving
privileges early by voluntarily installing an alcohol-sensing ignition interlock device
in your vehicle. The vehicle being operated will also be seized under the Vehicle
Impoundment program for a minimum of 30 days, to a maximum of 60 days if the
BAC is .16 or greater, or if the driver failed to comply with a demand.

Further consequences will be applied if the driver is found guilty of the offence in
court. The chart below outlines the consequences for impaired driving offences.

    Other Criminal Code driving offences
    Criminal negligence
    Driving with reckless disregard for life and safety is an offence. If you’re charged and
    convicted of a criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the penalties are increased.

    Dangerous driving
    Failing to exercise reasonable care in the operation of a motor vehicle is an offence.

    Failure to stop at scene of collision
    If you’re involved in a collision with a person, vehicle or cattle in the charge of a
    person, you must give your name, address, driver’s licence number and insurance
    information to any other involved people and assist any injured people.

    Drive while disqualiﬁed
    If you drive while you’re disqualiﬁed, you could face additional charges, vehicle
    impoundment, and other ﬁnancial consequences. It’s an offence under the Criminal
    Code to drive while disqualiﬁed.

    Arrest
    You may be arrested if you:
    • operate an unregistered vehicle
    • drive without a driver’s licence
    • fail to stop when signalled by police
    • drive without care and attention or without reasonable consideration for others
    • tamper with a vehicle
    • fail to provide information when requested by police
    • commit Criminal Code offences

    You may be arrested if the police have reason to believe you will not appear in court to
    answer your summons.

    Licence disqualiﬁcations
    If you’re convicted of any of the offences                    One conviction        1 year
    discussed in this section, your licence will be               Two convictions       3 years
    automatically cancelled and you will be disqualiﬁed           Three convictions     5 years
    from driving. The period of disqualiﬁcation will be
    based on the number of Criminal Code convictions
    you have had in the last 10 years.
    In addition to these automatic provincial disqualiﬁcations, the court may issue an order
    prohibiting you from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other
    public place anywhere in Canada for a period of time. You will not be allowed issue of
    a full unrestricted driver’s licence until the expiration of the longer period, whether it is
    the automatic disqualiﬁcation or the court order.

Reinstatement of driving privileges
If you’re convicted of a criminal offence you may be eligible for early reinstatement of
your driving privileges. Options for early reinstatement may include:
• ignition interlock special restricted driver’s licence
• special restricted driver’s licence

These options are issued on the provision that you have a zero tolerance for drugs
and alcohol while driving. This means no detectable amount of alcohol or drugs in
your system.

Ignition interlock special restricted driver’s licence
The Ignition Interlock program is a remedial program for drivers who have received
impaired driving suspensions or convictions. An ignition interlock device prevents
you from operating a vehicle if you have alcohol in your body. A device is installed in
the vehicle that is connected to the vehicle’s ignition that checks for the presence
of alcohol in the driver. The driver must blow into the machine to start the car, and
continue to periodically blow into the device to keep the car in motion. If the device
senses alcohol, the car will not start. If while in motion the device senses alcohol the
horn will start honking and headlights will ﬂash to draw attention to the vehicle. These
cannot be stopped until the vehicle is turned off.

The ignition interlock special restricted licence is mandatory for the following:
• Your conviction was for impaired driving, driving while equal to or over the legal limit for
  alcohol or a combination of alcohol and drugs, or for failing to comply with a demand.
• You received a third roadside suspension within the last 10 years and it’s alcohol-
  related. (Note: If you received your ﬁrst two roadside licence suspensions as a new
  driver, those count towards the number of offences as an experienced driver.)

The ignition interlock special restricted licence is voluntary for the following:
• You received a second roadside licence suspension as a new driver within the last
  10 years.
• You received an indeﬁnite roadside administrative suspension for an alcohol-related
  Criminal Code offence and you’ve served at least 90 days of your suspension.

The device must remain in the vehicle until the ignition interlock suspension period
ends. You cannot wait out your suspension period.

Eligibility and program duration
The Ignition Interlock program is mandatory for certain impaired driving offences, the
length of the mandatory term depends on how many prior offences the driver has in
the past 10 years, and the type of impaired driving offence.

      8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada • 8.3 Trafﬁc tickets



    You’re not eligible for early reinstatement of your driving privileges by installing an
    ignition interlock device if you’ve been declared ineligible by a judge, your conviction
    is not alcohol-related, or because you’ve been convicted under the Criminal Code of
    Canada for any impaired driving offence causing bodily injury or death.

    Special restricted driver’s licence
    A restricted driver’s licence limits when and where you can drive. You may be granted
    a restricted licence if you demonstrate that:
    • the licence suspension would cause you exceptional hardship
    • allowing for a restricted licence would not be contrary to public interest

    You’re eligible to apply to the Highway Trafﬁc Board for a special restricted licence if
    the following applies to you:
    • Your conviction is non-alcohol/drug related and you have served the entire court-
      ordered prohibition period and completed the required educational program.
    • Your conviction is alcohol/drug related and you have completed the required
      educational program and your mandatory ignition interlock term, and still must serve
      the provincial suspension.
    • You paid the $75 reinstatement fee.


    8.3 Trafﬁc tickets
    When the police charge you with a violation, they’ll issue a ticket indicating the
    offence you committed as well as the date, time and location. The ticket will also
    indicate where and when you are to appear in court. Some tickets, including those for
    stunting, racing and driving at excessive speeds, will result in an immediate roadside
    suspension.

    For some less serious offences, the ticket will indicate the amount of the ﬁne you must
    pay. If you choose to plead guilty, you may pay your ﬁne voluntarily through the mail or
    online, if available.

    You must appear in court to enter a not guilty plea. You’ll then have a trial date set.
    You may want to consult a lawyer before entering a plea.

8.4 Driver Improvement Program
The Driver Improvement Program monitors the driving records of all Saskatchewan
drivers. The program aims to make Saskatchewan roads safer for everyone by
reducing the incidence of high-risk behaviours by motorists.

Impaired driving is one example of high-risk driving, but many motorists endanger
the lives of others through behaviours that frequently cause motor vehicle collisions,
including speeding, running red lights and stunting.

Under this program, drivers are assigned points every time they are convicted of a
trafﬁc offence or have an at-fault collision. Drivers who reach their maximum threshold
of points are sent a warning letter to advise that tougher sanctions will follow should
their driving record continue to deteriorate.

Drivers who continue their high-risk behaviour face consequences that include ﬁnes,
driver’s licence re-testing, driver’s licence suspensions of up to six months and
completion of a driver improvement training program.

For more information on the Driver Improvement Program, call 1-844-TLK-2SGI
(1-844-855-2744).

    8.5 Safe Driver Recognition
    The Safe Driver Recognition (SDR) program rewards safe drivers with a discount on
    their vehicle insurance.

    If you own or lease a vehicle registered in Class LV, PV or F (one ton model or
    smaller), you may be eligible to receive a discount on your vehicle insurance premium.
    That discount will apply to every qualifying vehicle you insure.

    On the other hand, the program also ensures drivers who demonstrate risky behaviour
    pay their share in ﬁnancial penalties - helping offset the costs of the discount for safe
    drivers.

How it works
The Safety Zone – Discounts
For every year since 1995 that you have driven without an incident, you earn a safety
point. Each point in the Safety Zone corresponds to a discount on your vehicle plate
insurance, to a maximum of 25%.

Even if you don’t own a vehicle, a positive rating in the Safety Zone is beneﬁcial to
you. It protects all safe drivers from ﬁnancial penalties if they are involved in future
incidents.

You only receive a ﬁnancial penalty for an incident if it causes you to lose enough
points to move you to the Penalty Zone on the scale. As long as you remain in the
Safety Zone, you continue to receive some level of discount.

You’re eligible for a Safe Driver Recognition discount on your registered motorcycle
plates, if you get:
• To the Novice 2 stage of the Motorcycle Graduated Driver Licensing program and
  take an SGI -approved motorcycle training course, or
• Your full M Endorsement.

3 discount zones
• Good Drivers Zone (+1 to +10) - If you’re in the Good Drivers Zone, you have
  earned enough safety rating points to receive a discount on your basic vehicle
  insurance. For each year you drive incident-free, you earn a safety rating point that
  gives you 2% off your basic vehicle insurance.
• Great Drivers Zone (+11 to +20) - If you’re in the Great Drivers Zone, you have
  earned enough safety rating points to receive a 20% discount on your basic vehicle
  insurance, plus you have earned a cushion to shield you from losing some or all of
  your discount if you cause a collision or get trafﬁc convictions in the future.
• Safest Drivers Zone (+21 to +25) - If you’re in the Safest Drivers Zone, you have
  driven incident-free for more than 20 years. You earn an extra 1% discount for each
  additional year you drive incident-free up to a maximum discount of 25%.

The Penalty Zone – Financial penalties
Drivers lose points for unsafe driving - such as being at fault for a collision or certain
trafﬁc convictions and roadside suspensions. Driving disqualiﬁcations automatically
move drivers to -20 or lower, regardless of where they were on the scale prior.

Financial penalties are assessed for incidents that result in a safety rating below zero.
• You’re assessed a ﬁnancial penalty of $50 for each point you move in the Penalty
  Zone (capped at a maximum penalty of $1,000).
• The further an incident moves you into the Penalty Zone, the more you pay for that
  incident. The maximum penalty noted above applies to most incidents, with the
  exception of certain Criminal Code convictions. The maximum penalty for a Criminal
  Code conviction is $2,500, which is for offences that result in bodily injury or death.

    Motorists are assessed the penalty immediately and have 90 days to pay the charge.
    These penalties are in addition to ﬁnes handed out by law enforcement for trafﬁc
    convictions.

    Moving out of the Penalty Zone
    Each year of incident-free driving moves you one point back towards the Safety Zone.
    As long as you are moving towards the Safety Zone, you don’t pay another ﬁnancial
    penalty - you pay only your basic vehicle insurance premium. In other words, you don’t
    pay your way out of the Penalty Zone - you drive your way out of the Penalty Zone
    through safe driving.

    After three consecutive years of safe driving, drivers still remaining in the Penalty Zone
    automatically move out of the Penalty Zone and return to neutral (the starting point),
    and can begin to earn points towards a discount again.

 Fuel-efﬁcient driving techniques




Fuel-efﬁcient driving techniques
Safety should be your number one concern every time you get behind the wheel of
a vehicle. The good news is that practising fuel-efﬁcient driving techniques not only
improves road safety, it also reduces fuel consumption and cuts exhaust emissions
that contribute to climate change and urban smog. Depending on your driving habits
and how often you drive, these basic techniques and useful tips could save you
hundreds of dollars a year in fuel and maintenance costs:

• It’s both safer and more fuel efﬁcient to maintain a steady speed on a road.
  Accelerate smoothly when passing or merging with faster trafﬁc and avoid hard
  braking. European tests have shown that aggressive driving, including frequent rapid
  acceleration and hard braking, can increase fuel consumption by approximately
  40%.
• Drive at the posted speed limit. Lowering your highway cruising speed from
  120 km/h to 100 km/h will reduce fuel consumption by up to 20%.
• Plan your trips to combine errands and to avoid trafﬁc jams, steep hills, road
  construction, etc. Combining a number of short trips into one longer one allows your
  engine and drivetrain to reach peak operating temperature, which is not possible on
  trips of less than 5 km. Avoiding trouble spots shortens your travel time and reduces
  unnecessary idling.
• If you are driving a vehicle with a manual transmission, learn how to use it properly
  for maximum fuel savings. A tachometer can help you shift the transmission at the
  most fuel-efﬁcient engine speeds (the owner’s manual will indicate these speeds).
• If you have cruise control, use it for highway driving to maintain a constant speed.
  The exception is on hilly terrain, where it’s a good idea to allow the vehicle’s speed
  to drop slightly going uphill and then let gravity help you build up speed again (to a
  safe level) going down the other side.
• In summer, minimize your use of air conditioning. Operating an air conditioner in
  hot weather can increase fuel consumption by more than 20% in city driving.
  A more fuel-efﬁcient option for staying cool is to open a window. However, at
  highway speeds, use your car’s ﬂow-through ventilation – open windows and
  sunroofs increase aerodynamic drag, which makes the engine work harder and
  consume more fuel. If you must use your vehicle’s air conditioning, avoid running
  it continuously. Shut it off after the interior is cool or set the controls to a comfort
  level that allows the system to cycle.
• Check tire pressure at least once a month when the tires are cold (i.e., the vehicle
  has been stationary for at least three hours or has not been driven more than 2 km).
  If you have to drive more than 2 km to add air, check the tires before you leave and
  then add the amount of air that is missing from this reading. Inﬂate the tires to the
  recommended pressure, usually indicated on the car door, glove compartment or
  in the owner’s manual. With proper tire inﬂation, your car will burn less fuel and
  be safer to drive. A vehicle with tires that are under-inﬂated by a total of 10 psi
  increases fuel consumption by 5%.

• Use a block heater in the winter to warm the engine oil and make cold starts easier
  on your engine components. Your vehicle’s oil doesn’t freeze when the temperature
  dips below 0˚C, but it does get much thicker. This means your engine has to work
  harder and use more fuel. Use a timer to switch the block heater on two hours
  before you plan to drive. Proper use of a block heater can improve your vehicle’s
  overall fuel economy by as much as 10%. Still, don’t leave your block heater on
  overnight or your energy savings will disappear in a higher electricity bill.
• Follow the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended operating procedures and
  maintenance schedule in your owner’s manual. Regular maintenance such as oil and
  ﬁlter changes will not only prevent early degeneration of your vehicle’s components,
  it will also keep them operating at their most fuel-efﬁcient level. A clogged air
  ﬁlter can increase fuel consumption by up to 10%. Regular maintenance will keep
  your vehicle operating safely, save you money and, at the same time, help the
  environment.
• Remote car starters are handy on cold winter mornings, but don’t start your car
  too soon. In most driving conditions, today’s modern engines need less warm-up
  time even on cold mornings. Also, allowing your car to idle too long wastes gas and
  produces unnecessary exhaust emissions.
• Idling for more than 10 seconds, except in trafﬁc, wastes more fuel than stopping
  your engine and restarting again. At the end of the day, stopping unnecessary idling
  will beneﬁt the environment and save you money.
