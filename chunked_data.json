    "content": "\n2. Saskatchewan\u2019s driver\u2019s licence program\nDriver programs and examinations are designed to develop safe and capable drivers who know and understand the rules of the road. Driving is a responsibility and a privilege. It\u2019s not a right. Provincial regulations exist to meet safety needs as well as promote the efficient and safe flow of traffic.\n\nTo drive in Saskatchewan you must hold a valid driver\u2019s licence for the type of vehicle you wish to operate. The classified driver\u2018s licence system establishes minimum standards of skill, knowledge, physical and mental fitness for the safe operation of different types of vehicles. Drivers are then licensed accordingly.\n\nThe first time you apply for a Saskatchewan driver\u2019s licence, you\u2019ll be asked to provide documents to prove your identity, proof of residency and entitlement to be in Canada. Each document must be from an authority such as a federal or provincial government or a federal agency (a full list of approved documents can be found at sgi.sk.ca/identity-and-residency-verification and in SGI\u2019s Establishing Your Identity pamphlet). They must also be originals, not photocopies. Electronic scans of these documents may be kept on file, in keeping with Canadian standards.\n\nTo get a driver\u2019s licence, you must be able to operate a vehicle safely and properly, understand all traffic signs and know the rules of the road. You\u2019re required to complete a driver\u2019s examination if you:\n\u2022 Have never been a licensed driver;\n\u2022 Have not held a Saskatchewan driver\u2019s licence or specific Class or Endorsement within the past five years;\n\u2022 Wish to become a certified driver instructor in Saskatchewan;\n\u2022 Want to change the class of your licence or obtain an endorsement; or\n\u2022 Are a new resident, and the licence you hold is from another province, state or country not honoured or recognized in Saskatchewan. Licences may be honoured from the United States. Licences from Germany, Switzerland, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Isle of Man, Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Japan, Jersey, Netherlands, New Zealand, Ukraine and Taiwan may be exchanged for a Saskatchewan Class 5 driver\u2019s licence and motorcycle endorsement, where applicable. Saskatchewan may also accept a driver\u2019s licence from a country not listed. Please check with any Saskatchewan motor licence issuer, driver examination office, or visit www.sgi.sk.ca/newresidents or contact us toll free at 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744). The nine-month learning period and driver training requirement may be waived if you can prove past driving experience by providing a valid driver\u2019s licence, written in English or French, or a valid licence in another language accompanied by a translation document acceptable to SGI (i.e. International Driving Permit).\n\nIf you\u2019re a new resident wanting a Saskatchewan driver\u2019s licence without being tested, you must meet some requirements:\n\u2022 If you\u2019re a former resident of a Canadian province or territory you must have a valid driver\u2019s licence from that jurisdiction. An expired driver\u2019s licence (not older than five years) from that jurisdiction is also acceptable. New residents may drive with their valid out-of-province driver\u2019s licence for 90 days after moving to Saskatchewan.\n",

        "content": "All vehicles must be properly registered according to purpose and must display the appropriate licence plate.\n\nLicence plates must be securely attached and clearly visible. That means plates must not be obstructed in a way that prevents them from being read or accurately photographed by any enforcement system.\n\nThe number or identity of the licence plate must not be altered or changed in any way.\n\nIf you're a new resident you have up to 90 days to register your vehicle in Saskatchewan. Basic insurance coverage is required. A non-resident (someone who does not own, rent or lease a residence in Saskatchewan and, if required, does not pay Saskatchewan income tax) may drive in Saskatchewan indefinitely providing your out-of-province or out-of-country driver's licence remains valid.\n\nHow auto insurance works in Saskatchewan\n\nSaskatchewan auto insurance comes in two parts:\n\nBasic minimum coverage – Is required by law and is purchased at the same time you pay for your licence plates and vehicle registration. This coverage is compulsory and is provided by SGI.\n\nAdditional coverage – Sometimes referred to as extended auto insurance, a package policy or an Auto Pak, additional coverage is tailored to your needs and is provided on a separate auto insurance policy. This important protection may be purchased from the insurance company, broker or agent of your choice.\n\nLicence plate insurance coverage\n\nYour licence plate carries basic insurance coverage in three areas:\n\nCollision and comprehensive – Coverage for damage to your vehicle, subject to a deductible.\n\nPersonal injury – Benefits for personal injury resulting from a vehicle collision.\n\nLiability – Insurance for damage your vehicle causes to another vehicle or property, or injury to others.\n\nCollision and comprehensive is also known as physical damage coverage. It pays for damage to your vehicle due to a collision or other occurrence such as hail, fire or theft.*\n\nPersonal injury benefits provide Saskatchewan residents with injury and death benefits if they are injured or killed in an automobile collision anywhere in Canada or the United States. All Saskatchewan residents have a choice between two equally priced auto injury coverages – No Fault Coverage and Tort Coverage.\n\n* Most vehicles are covered to the actual cash value, which is the market value of your vehicle compared with similar vehicles, with similar equipment, mileage and condition to the insured vehicle (see Coverage Limitations referenced in the Driver’s Licence and Basic Insurance brochure).\n\n Liability coverage protects you as a vehicle owner and driver if you and/or your\\n vehicle are responsible for injuries caused to others or damage to property belonging\\n to others. \u2018Others\u2019 may be another motorist, a pedestrian or bicyclist, a passenger in\\n your vehicle, or the owner of property you damage.\\n\\nTo be liable is to be at fault and responsible for damage or injury. You can be\\n liable whether you choose No Fault or Tort injury (all Saskatchewan residents are\\n automatically covered with No Fault injury coverage unless they choose Tort injury\\n coverage and file a declaration form). Liability coverage will pay the cost to defend\\n you if someone claims you are liable, as well as the damages if you are found\\n responsible.\\n\\nPlate insurance provides up to $200,000 in liability coverage. Although\\n compensation for many injuries and damages is covered under the collision\\n and comprehensive coverage or the personal injury benefits, there are also many\\n situations where compensation will be based on who is at fault, what happened and\\n where it happened (for instance, if you were driving in the U.S. or another Canadian\\n province). These include damage to buildings or fences near a street, to cargo in a\\n vehicle you collide with, or to trains, cargo, and tracks at a level crossing, including\\n environmental damage. If you\u2019re responsible for an injury or death in Saskatchewan of\\n someone whose earnings were greater than the personal injury benefit amount, or to\\n anyone out of province, you will likely have a liability claim.\\n\\nNo Fault Coverage\\nSaskatchewan residents with No Fault Coverage receive a comprehensive package\\n of benefits regardless of the circumstances of the collision. Benefits include coverage\\n for income loss, medical and rehabilitation expenses, permanent impairment and\\n death benefits. Those with No Fault Coverage can sue for certain expenses not\\n covered by their benefits, as well as for income loss which exceeds the benefits\\n provided by the plan. Except in very limited circumstances, they cannot sue for pain\\n and suffering.\\n\\nTort Coverage\\nSaskatchewan residents with Tort Coverage receive a basic package of benefits\\n regardless of the circumstances of the collision. Benefits include some coverage for\\n income loss, medical and rehabilitation expenses, permanent impairment and death\\n benefits. Those with Tort Coverage who are not totally at fault for the collision can\\n sue for expenses and income losses not covered by their benefits and for pain and\\n suffering, subject to a $5,000 deductible.\\n\\nFor more information on No Fault Coverage, Tort Coverage or how to choose your\\n auto injury insurance, visit [www.sgi.sk.ca](https://www.sgi.sk.ca) or ask any SGI office or SGI motor licence\\n issuing office for informational materials that explain the coverages.\\n\\nYour vehicle deductible\\nYour plate insurance covers loss of, or damage to, your vehicle and its equipment\\n from causes such as a collision, upset, fire, theft, windstorm or hail. Subject to your\\n deductible.\\n\\nA deductible is applicable to any vehicle loss you may have. It\u2019s the amount you\\n are required to pay before your licence plate insurance benefits begin to cover the\\n remaining costs.\\n\\nFor example, if your deductible is $700 and you\u2019re responsible for a collision which\\n causes $2,000 worth of damage to your vehicle, then SGI will pay for damage in\\n excess of your deductible. You\u2019ll be responsible for the first $700, while SGI will pay\\n the remaining $1,300.\\n\\nHowever, if it\u2019s determined that another Saskatchewan driver/owner is responsible\\n for the damage and that person can be identified, that person\u2019s insurance will pay\\n for your damage, including your deductible and any other reasonable out-of-pocket\\n expenses.\\n\\nCoverage for specific single-vehicle losses\\nSingle-vehicle collision \u2013 Your damages are covered for the amount in excess of your\\n deductible. You may be able to recover your deductible when there is a responsible\\n party to pursue. Your adjuster will assist you with this. In most single-vehicle collisions\\n the driver is responsible and must pay their own deductible.\\n\\nStorm or weather-related damage \u2013 Even though you\u2019re not at fault for weather-\\n related damage, such as hail damage or a tree falling on your vehicle, the deductible\\n applies as there is no responsible party to pursue.\\n\\nCollision with an animal \u2013 If you carry only the compulsory plate insurance, the\\n deductible applies. If you carry additional auto insurance the deductible may be\\n waived for a collision with an animal.\\n\\nHit and run \u2013 Your damages are covered for the amount in excess of your deductible.\\n You may be able to recover your deductible if the responsible party is identified. Your\\n adjuster will assist you with this.\\n\\nTheft or vandalism \u2013 If you carry only the compulsory plate insurance, the deductible\\n applies. If the responsible party is identified, you may be able to recover your\\n deductible. If you carry additional auto insurance the deductible may be waived for\\n theft of the entire vehicle.\\n\\nCoverage for multiple-vehicle losses\\nYou\u2019re not at fault for the collision \u2013 You don\u2019t pay the deductible in most cases. The\\n party found at fault for the collision is responsible for your damage, including your\\n deductible. Once your adjuster has confirmed your coverage, you may have your\\n vehicle repaired at the autobody shop of your choice.\\n\\nYou\u2019re at fault for the collision \u2013 As the at-fault driver you\u2019re responsible for your full\\n deductible. Your licence plate insurance will also pay the other driver\u2019s deductible and\\n cover any damage to their vehicle.\\n\\nShared responsibility for the collision \u2013 When two motorists are each found partially\\n responsible for a collision, both drivers pay a portion of their deductible if their vehicle\\n is damaged. For example, if you\u2019re found 25% responsible for a collision you pay 25%\\n of your deductible.\\n\\nPersonal Auto Injury Insurance\\nThe Personal Auto Injury Insurance program provides coverage for Saskatchewan\\n residents injured in automobile collisions anywhere in Canada or the United States.\\n Coverage provided depends on which of two auto injury products you choose \u2013 No\\n Fault Coverage or Tort Coverage.\\n\\nExtended Auto Insurance\\nBasic plate insurance allows you to drive with minimal coverage, but to protect\\n yourself, your family, your passengers, and your vehicle, you may find you\u2019ll need more\\n than just the basics. A licensed insurance broker or agent will explain your options\\n and provide advice on economical ways to obtain the protection you need.\\n\\nExtended auto insurance can cover your vehicle for replacement cost, pay for the\\n cost of a rental if your vehicle is damaged, reduce the deductible you pay for damage\\n to your vehicle and top-up your injury coverage. Most importantly, it increases your\\n liability from the minimum $200,000.\\n\\nDespite your efforts to be a good driver, a moment of distraction, tiredness,\\n inexperience, poor road conditions and many other things can result in major\\n collisions. You can be sued and held responsible for damages if you\u2019re at fault \u2013 even\\n if you have No Fault injury coverage. If you don\u2019t have enough insurance or the means\\n to pay for your defence or the damages caused, you may be expected to pay\\n a portion of your earnings for many years as a result of lacking enough coverage.\\n",

    "title": "BASIC INFORMATION AND RULES OF THE ROAD",
    "content": "The six basic driving conditions\n\nDriver condition refers to your physical, mental and emotional fitness to drive. It’s the most important of the six conditions, because a driver in top physical, mental and emotional shape can adjust to all the other conditions and to the errors of other drivers as well.\n\nVehicle condition affects your ability to control your vehicle, your ability to see and be seen, and to communicate with other drivers and pedestrians. Your chances of staying out of a collision are better with a vehicle in tip-top condition than they are with one that has operational defects. You are the only one who knows when something isn’t working right. Only you can spot possible vehicle defects and either repair them or get them corrected by a qualified mechanic.\n\nLight condition: The first requirement of safe driving is to see and be seen. This ability is affected by light condition. The presence of natural or artificial light; you can have too little light, or too much light. The hazard of too little light is found in the fact that the nighttime fatal collision rate is more than double the daytime rate.\n\nWeather condition: Bad weather can affect traction, visibility and vehicle control. Rain, snow and ice make road surfaces slippery. Adverse weather can obscure your vision with rain, snow, fog or road splatter, as well, steam up glass with interior vapour. Other drivers find it harder to see you, and pedestrians hide behind umbrellas so they fail to see cars approaching. High winds make steering difficult and cause vehicles to veer to the wrong side of the road.\n\nRoad condition refers to the total roadway and the type and condition of the road surface. These can affect your ability to steer, stop and manoeuvre. Adverse road conditions can be produced by weather. Conditions change from one kind of road to another – from a side street to a thoroughfare, from a secondary road to a main highway, from a two-lane road to an expressway. Any trip may involve a number of different road conditions, each requiring an adjustment in your driving.",

        "content": "Traffic condition\nTraffic conditions are created by the number of vehicles and pedestrians using the same road or street at the same time you are, and to a large extent by how well the road has been engineered to accommodate the amount of traffic present at a given time. More cars mean more conflict in traffic and more chance for a collision. Traffic conditions are influenced by the time of day, day of the week, even time of year in the case of holiday periods, and by the nature of the environment, such as a shopping centre, sports arena, factory or school.\n\nThere are speed limits on all Saskatchewan roads, streets and highways. Always drive your vehicle within the posted speed limit. Emergency vehicles responding to an emergency may exceed the speed limit. On most provincial highways, and in urban areas, speed limit signs are posted. In the absence of signs, the speed limit is 80 km/h. Most urban centres post speed limit signs at the entrances to the town or city. Those speed limits apply to all locations within community boundaries, unless otherwise posted. The speed limit means the fastest you can travel under ideal conditions. Stunting and racing can have serious and often life-threatening consequences.\n\nSome of the things that could land you a ticket, licence suspension and impoundment are:\n• racing side by side with another vehicle while disobeying the speed limit\n• chasing another vehicle\n• speeding in and out of lanes to unsafely pass vehicles\n• attempting to lift some or all tires from the roadway (including driving a motorcycle on one wheel)\n• attempting to spin a vehicle to cause it to spin or circle\n• driving a vehicle while not sitting in the driver’s seat\n• driving your vehicle in a way that prevents another vehicle from passing\n• stopping or slowing down to interfere with the movement of another vehicle\n\nThe maximum speed limit when passing tow trucks or emergency vehicles that are stopped with their lights flashing or when passing Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure equipment with lights flashing, whether in motion or not, is 60 km/h. Within the work zone (road maintenance areas), motorists are required to slow down and travel no faster than the posted speed. Fines for speeding triple when passing highway workers or equipment occupied by a worker in the work zone. Some cities have bylaws requiring drivers to obey work zone speed limits through the entire construction area. Please be familiar with the bylaws in your area. Drivers are also required to reduce their speed to 60 km/h when passing a tow truck stopped on the roadside with its amber or amber and blue lights flashing while it’s assisting to a disabled vehicle.\n\nIn school zones drivers must be particularly careful. Each city or town sets speed limits in school zones through local bylaws. As a result, laws vary from place to place so watch for signs. If there are no signs, you should still reduce your speed and proceed cautiously in school zones.",

Photo radar tickets are issued to the registered owner of the speeding vehicle driven through the zone. You must slow down when approaching animals on or near the road. Regardless of the posted or basic speed limit you must never travel faster than conditions allow for safe and reasonable passage. At the same time, travelling too slowly can be hazardous. You should never drive at a speed slow enough to impede or block other traffic, unless proper safety precautions have been taken.\n\nAlways drive with care, attention and reasonable consideration for other road users. It’s illegal for you, or any of your passengers, to perform stunts or other activities that distract, startle or interfere with other road users.\n\nDriver inattention and distraction is responsible for 14% of all collisions. On average, it leads to 19 fatalities a year in Saskatchewan (based on an average from 2019 – 2021).\n\nDriving requires you to do more than two things at once – steering, braking, shifting gears and watching for traffic all occur at the same time. When you add distractions like eating, grooming, talking or texting on cellphones, the results can be disastrous. Drivers should devote their full attention to driving. Some of the most common driver distractions include persons, objects or events outside the vehicle, distraction from passengers, looking for or at something in the vehicle, adjusting radio, climate or vehicle controls, smoking and eating or drinking.\n\nYou also shouldn’t distract other road users - deliberately creating loud and unnecessary noise with a motor vehicle is not permitted.",

            "content": "The large truck is a special vehicle. Its motor is not much larger than a large car engine and yet the load it carries can be 50 or more times the weight of a car. When accelerating up to speed, truck drivers use up to 18 gear changes. Once they get into top gear, they do not appreciate having to start again. Therefore, avoid forcing a truck driver to slow down.\n\nLarge trucks will decrease speed when going uphill. You can expect truck drivers to pick up speed when going down hills to help them get up the other side. Plan your passing manoeuvre accordingly.\n\nIt takes longer to stop a large truck than a car, so a truck driver needs a longer following distance to be safe and in control. Don’t cut in front of a large truck immediately after you have passed it.\n\nTruck drivers have problems seeing smaller vehicles. Although they have mirrors that help them to see each side, you may not be visible to the driver if you follow too closely. (Besides, you can’t see anything yourself.) Realize that in poor weather, exterior mirrors become spotted with rain and dirt and the truck driver doesn’t have an interior mirror. Be sure to make yourself visible. Drive with your headlights on.\n\nThe driver of a large truck or bus has difﬁculty turning sharp corners, particularly to the right. If the driver follows the proper procedure, vehicles facing them on the street they are entering should be prepared for the large truck or bus to enter their half of the roadway. If the large truck operator is not following the proper procedure, vehicles on their right in the street they are leaving should stay well back to avoid being crushed between the large truck and the curb. When you see a large truck or bus making a sharp right turn, give it the room it needs.\n\nAll drivers should avoid a large truck’s “no-zone.” The no-zone refers to the blindspot areas around big trucks, where crashes are most likely to occur. Just like cars, large trucks have blindspots on both sides, but a large truck’s are considerably bigger. These blindspots can mean trouble if a trucker decides to change lanes and a car is in the blindspot. In addition to the blindspots on the sides of a large truck, drivers should be careful around the front end of large trucks.\n\nTruckers sit up high and the hood of the cab obscures part of the road ahead. This is why when drivers in a car are passing a large truck, they should make sure they can see the entire truck cab in their rear-view mirror before pulling in front. If a car cuts in too soon, truck drivers are forced to react with little time or room to spare. Large trucks also have deep rear blindspots. A good rule of thumb is that if you can’t see the large truck’s mirrors, the truck driver can’t see you.",

Sometimes you will need to enter or cross a bike lane to turn right at a corner or driveway. Take extra care when you do this. Enter the bike lane only after ensuring that you can do so safely, and then make the turn.\n\nWhen you’re sharing the road with cyclists please remember:\n• Many children riding bicycles on the street are very young and lack the necessary training and skills for safe cycling.\n• When passing or overtaking a cyclist, go around them like you would any other vehicle.\n• Watch for cyclists’ hand signals. A cyclist may indicate a right-hand turn by extending their right arm. If possible, try to make eye contact with cyclists.\n• When turning left, you must stop and wait for oncoming bicycles to pass before turning.\n• When driving through an intersection, be careful to scan for cyclists waiting to turn left.\n• When you’re preparing to make a right turn, watch for cyclists who may pull up alongside your vehicle. Check your blind spots.\n• When making a right turn, do not pull up beside a cyclist and then turn directly in front of them and cut them off.\n• When pulling away from the curb always check for cyclists who may be travelling near the right edge of the lane or curb.\n• When parked at the curb, always check for cyclists when you open your vehicle door.\n• Give cyclists space with a safe following distance. They do not have brake lights to warn you when they’re slowing or stopping.\n• Cyclists are entitled to make left turns the same way as motorists. Since they are exposed on left turns, they will need extra consideration, especially on multi-lane roads.\n• It’s easy to misjudge the speed of bicycles — they can travel faster than you think! Experienced cyclists can travel at 25-35 km/h on a ﬂat surface and up to 50km/h going downhill.\n• Cyclists are entitled to ride at least one metre from the curb and may ride even further out when they steer away from drainage grates, potholes, debris, loose gravel or sand, wet or slippery surfaces, rutted or grooved pavement and even dogs. Be aware of the roadway conditions that may affect a cyclist.\n• Don’t use your horn when you’re passing a cyclist. It may frighten them and cause them to steer into your path. If you feel that you must use your horn, tap it quickly and lightly while you are still some distance away from the cyclist.\n\nThere’s also a class of bicycle called power-assisted bicycles, commonly known as e-bikes or electric bicycles and many are designed to look like scooters equipped with pedals. These types of vehicles use an electric motor to help the operator up to a maximum speed of 32 km/h. Treat them the same way you would any other cyclist.",

The more\n    you know about the particular driving requirements of different vehicles, the better\n    equipped you’ll be to share the road and predict the actions of other drivers.\n\n    Sharing the road with large trucks\n    The large truck is a special vehicle. Its motor is not\n    much larger than a large car engine and yet the load\n    it carries can be 50 or more times the weight of a car.\n    When accelerating up to speed, truck drivers use up\n    to 18 gear changes. Once they get into top gear, they\n    do not appreciate having to start again. Therefore,\n    avoid forcing a truck driver to slow down.\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.4 Sharing the road\nLarge trucks will decrease speed when going uphill. You can expect truck drivers to\npick up speed when going down hills to help them get up the other side. Plan your\npassing manoeuvre accordingly.\n\nIt takes longer to stop a large truck than a car, so a truck driver needs a longer\nfollowing distance to be safe and in control. Don’t cut in front of a large truck\nimmediately after you have passed it.\n\nTruck drivers have problems seeing smaller vehicles. Although they have mirrors\nthat help them to see each side, you may not be visible to the driver if you follow\ntoo closely. (Besides, you can’t see anything yourself.) Realize that in poor weather,\nexterior mirrors become spotted with rain and dirt and the truck driver doesn’t have an\ninterior mirror. Be sure to make yourself visible. Drive with your headlights on.\n\nThe driver of a large truck or bus has difﬁculty turning sharp corners, particularly to\nthe right. If the driver follows the proper procedure, vehicles facing them on the street\nthey are entering should be prepared for the large truck or bus to enter their half of\nthe roadway. If the large truck operator is not following the proper procedure, vehicles\non their right in the street they are leaving should stay well back to avoid being\ncrushed between the large truck and the curb. When you see a large truck or bus\nmaking a sharp right turn, give it the room it needs.\n\nAll drivers should avoid a large truck’s “no-zone.” The no-zone refers to the blindspot\nareas around big trucks, where crashes are most likely to occur. Just like cars, large\ntrucks have blindspots on both sides, but a large truck’s are considerably bigger.\nThese blindspots can mean trouble if a trucker decides to change lanes and a car is in\nthe blindspot. In addition to the blindspots on the sides of a large truck, drivers should\nbe careful around the front end of large trucks.\n\nTruckers sit up high and the hood of the cab obscures part of the road ahead. This is\nwhy when drivers in a car are passing a large truck, they should make sure they can\nsee the entire truck cab in their rear-view mirror before pulling in front. If a car cuts\nin too soon, truck drivers are forced to react with little time or room to spare. Large\ntrucks also have deep rear blindspots. A good rule of thumb is that if you can’t see the\nlarge truck’s mirrors, the truck driver can’t see you.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.4 Sharing the road\n\n\n\n\n    Sharing the road with snow plows\n    • Slow down – STAY BACK and STAY ALIVE when you\n      approach the mini blizzard created by a snow plow.\n    • Every winter, snow plows are hit by motorists who don’t\n      see them or see them too late. The vast majority of these\n      incidents are rear-end collisions where motorists have\n      failed to adjust to changing road and weather conditions.\n    • Snow plow operators are working in difﬁcult weather conditions on the highways to\n      clear snow and ice and make the roads safer for all motorists.\n    • Drivers must slow to 60 km/h when passing snow plows or other highway\n      equipment that are stopped on the highway with blue and amber warning lights\n      ﬂashing.\n    • Snow plows that are in motion, can be passed on the highway if it’s safe to do so.\n      Drivers in this case are not limited to travelling 60 km/h.\n    • Snow plows must travel slower than average trafﬁc when clearing snow and\n      spreading salt and sand. Be patient and proceed with caution.\n    • Ministry of Highways crews clear major highways within six hours of the end of the\n      storm to make winter driving safe. Please give them room to work safely.\n\n    Sharing the road with snowmobiles, ATVs\n    and golf carts\n    If snowmobiles and ATVs were always operated\n    according to the law, there would be little chance of\n    conﬂict with other vehicles on the streets and highways.\n    Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case.\n\n    Snowmobiles are difﬁcult to see because they are small\n    and low. These features, accompanied by exposure\n    to weather, also make it difﬁcult for the snowmobile\n    operator to see. As snowmobiles are useful in storms,\n    they’re likely to be out when visibility is poor.\n\n    Also, children with little road experience operate snowmobiles and ATVs. When you\n    see a snowmobile or ATV, anticipate that it may cross the road suddenly or go out of\n    control, and decide how you will react.\n\n    In some municipalities, local bylaws allow snowmobiles, ATVs and golf carts to be\n    operated on the street.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.4 Sharing the road\nSharing the road with emergency vehicles\nAll emergency vehicles (ﬁre engines, police vehicles\nambulances, and emergency vehicles that have been\ndesignated by a municipality or the Highway Trafﬁc\nBoard to be used in response to an emergency) have\nthe right of way when displaying ﬂashing lights and\nusing sirens (sound devices).\n• When approached by an emergency vehicle with\n  its lights ﬂashing or sirens engaged, you must\n  immediately drive as closely as possible to the\n  right edge of the roadway and not enter the next\n  intersection until the emergency vehicle has passed.\n  The only exception is if a peace ofﬁcer gives you\n  other directions. On one-way streets, pull right or left\n  to the nearest curb.\n• At an intersection, you must stop and let the emergency vehicle through the\n  intersection, unless given other directions by a peace ofﬁcer.\n\nIf the emergency vehicle has its lights ﬂashing, but no siren engaged, motorists in the\nvicinity should extend the same privilege as previously mentioned while meeting or\nbeing overtaken by the emergency vehicle.\n\n• When an emergency vehicle is stopped on the highway with its emergency lights in\n  operation, you must slow down to 60 km/h when passing it. This doesn’t apply to\n  vehicles travelling in the opposite direction on a divided highway. However, this does\n  apply when travelling in the opposite direction on an undivided highway.\n• Never attempt to follow an emergency vehicle going to, or coming from, an emergency.\n\nSharing the road with farm equipment and\noverwidth vehicles\nSaskatchewan’s agricultural base means that\nfarm equipment such as combines, tractors, large\ncultivators, etc. may be on highways and grid roads\nfrom early spring until late fall.\n\nThese vehicles create a hazard, as they travel very\nslowly – 10 to 40 km/h. Therefore, you may come\nupon them very quickly and you’ll need to stop or\nchange lanes rapidly. Watch for them on the road and\nonly pass them when it’s safe to do so.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.4 Sharing the road\n\n\n\n    Sharing the road with school buses\n    School bus drivers have a difﬁcult job. There are\n    plenty of distractions inside the bus. Knowing this,\n    you should make extra allowances, and be aware of\n    the possibility that the bus driver may not see you or\n    your signals. Rear-end collisions are the most frequent\n    type of crash involving school buses and are usually\n    caused by another driver failing to stop while the bus\n    is loading or unloading passengers.\n\n    When approaching a school bus, if you see amber ﬂashing lights, slow down and\n    proceed with caution. If the red ﬂashing lights are activated, you must come to a\n    complete stop. If you’re approaching the bus from the opposite direction on an\n    undivided highway, you must also stop. The single greatest threat to the safety of\n    children who ride school buses is motorists who pass the bus when children are\n    loading or unloading.\n\n    When approaching a bus that has its stop arm out and its red ﬂashing lights activated,\n    as a driver:\n    • You must stop no closer than 5 m (15 ft.) from the front or back of the bus.\n    • You must not advance your vehicle until the bus driver turns off the ﬂashing red stop\n      lamps and deactivates the stop arm.\n    • Before moving, check to see that all children have safely crossed the roadway.\n\n    Passing a school bus with red ﬂashing lights is a serious offence and will result in\n    a minimum ﬁne of $360. You don’t have to stop for a school bus if you’re travelling\n    in the opposite direction on a divided highway. Some cities, towns and villages may\n    have a bylaw prohibiting the use of ﬂashing red stop lamps and stop arms on school\n    buses. In those communities you’re allowed to pass the bus. Drivers aren’t required to\n    stop for buses displaying four-way hazard lamps; however, use caution, go slowly and\n    always watch for children crossing.\n\n    Sharing the road with motorcycles\n    When a motorcycle and a four-wheel vehicle collide,\n    the motorcyclist is at a high risk for being killed or\n    severely injured. Since motorcycles are more agile\n    than cars, their actions are more difﬁcult to predict and\n    their size makes them hard to see.\n\n    Most motorcycles are wired so that their headlights\n    are on at all times, making it easier for you to see\n    them. Be alert for motorcycles that don’t have their\n    headlights on. During motorcycle season, check twice\n    before making a lane change or turn – once for cars\n    and trucks, and once for motorcycles and bikes.\n\n    When passing a motorcycle, ensure you leave adequate distance ahead of the\n    motorcycle before you pull back in to the lane. Failure to leave sufﬁcient room can be\n    extremely dangerous for the motorcyclist.\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.4 Sharing the road\nThe same three-second following distance should be given to motorcycles as is given\nto other vehicles. Following too closely may cause a motorcycle rider’s attention to be\ndistracted from the road and trafﬁc ahead.\n\nMotorcyclists are allowed to ride two abreast but most riders prefer to have a full\nlane width. A skilled motorcyclist is constantly changing positions within a lane to\nincrease his ability to see and be seen, and to avoid objects on the road. Never move\ninto the same lane beside a motorcycle, even if the lane is wide and the motorcyclist\nis riding to one side. It is not only illegal, it’s extremely hazardous. When overtaking a\nmotorcycle or bicycle in your lane, you must pass in the same manner as you would\npass a car.\n\nBad weather and slippery surfaces cause greater problems for motorcycles than for\ncars. Allow more following distance for motorcycles when the road surface is wet and\nslippery. These conditions create stability problems.\n\nBeing aware of these situations can help you share the road safely with all cyclists.\n\nNew motorcyclists are required to display a\nMotorcycle Graduated Driver Licensing (MGDL)\nplacard on their licence plate identifying them\nas new riders. Learners are required to display\na red ‘L’ placard and Novice riders must display\ngreen ‘N’ placards. Please use caution when\npassing or following a new rider and give them\nplenty of space.\n\n\nSharing the road with bicycles\nBicycles are vehicles too and entitled to their\nshare of the road. More people are using them for\ntransportation, recreation, physical ﬁtness, and to\nreduce emissions. Cyclists must obey the same rules\nof the road as other vehicles.\n\nCyclists travelling at a lower speed than other trafﬁc\nare expected to ride about one metre from the curb or\nparked cars, or as close as practical to the right-hand\nedge of the road when there is no curb.\n• Cyclists are not required to ride close to the right edge of the road when they are\n  travelling at or faster than the normal speed of trafﬁc at that time and place, or when\n  they are turning left, or getting in position to turn left.\nBike lanes are reserved for cyclists. Sometimes you will need to enter or cross a bike\nlane to turn right at a corner or driveway. Take extra care when you do this. Enter the\nbike lane only after ensuring that you can do so safely, and then make the turn.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.4 Sharing the road\n\n\n\n    When you’re sharing the road with cyclists please remember:\n    • Many children riding bicycles on the street are very young and lack the necessary\n      training and skills for safe cycling.\n    • When passing or overtaking a cyclist, go around them like you would any other\n      vehicle.\n    • Watch for cyclists’ hand signals. A cyclist may indicate a right-hand turn by extending\n      their right arm. If possible, try to make eye contact with cyclists.\n    • When turning left, you must stop and wait for oncoming bicycles to pass before\n      turning.\n    • When driving through an intersection, be careful to scan for cyclists waiting to turn\n      left.\n    • When you’re preparing to make a right turn, watch for cyclists who may pull up\n      alongside your vehicle. Check your blind spots.\n    • When making a right turn, do not pull up beside a cyclist and then turn directly in front\n      of them and cut them off.\n    • When pulling away from the curb always check for cyclists who may be travelling near\n      the right edge of the lane or curb.\n    • When parked at the curb, always check for cyclists when you open your vehicle door.\n    • Give cyclists space with a safe following distance. They do not have brake lights to\n      warn you when they’re slowing or stopping.\n    • Cyclists are entitled to make left turns the same way as motorists. Since they\n      are exposed on left turns, they will need extra consideration, especially on\n      multi-lane roads.\n    • It’s easy to misjudge the speed of bicycles — they can travel faster than you think!\n      Experienced cyclists can travel at 25-35 km/h on a ﬂat surface and up to 50km/h\n      going downhill.\n    • Cyclists are entitled to ride at least one metre from the curb and may ride even further\n      out when they steer away from drainage grates, potholes, debris, loose gravel or sand,\n      wet or slippery surfaces, rutted or grooved pavement and even dogs. Be aware of the\n      roadway conditions that may affect a cyclist.\n    • Don’t use your horn when you’re passing a cyclist. It may frighten them and cause\n      them to steer into your path. If you feel that you must use your horn, tap it quickly and\n      lightly while you are still some distance away from the cyclist.\n    There’s also a class of bicycle called power-assisted bicycles, commonly known as\n    e-bikes or electric bicycles and many are designed to look like scooters equipped\n    with pedals. These types of vehicles use an electric motor to help the operator up to a\n    maximum speed of 32 km/h. Treat them the same way you would any other cyclist.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.4 Sharing the road\nSharing the road with e-scooters\n(electric kick scooters)\nE-scooters (also known as electric kick scooters or\nelectric scooters) are known as limited speed motor\nvehicles and are permitted in communities, towns, or\ncities that have speciﬁc e-scooter bylaws in place. To\nsee if they’re legal in your community, please reach out\nto your municipality directly.\nE-scooters don’t need to be registered and don’t require a driver’s licence, but users\nmust be at least 16 years old, wear an approved helmet, follow all municipal laws and\nprovincial regulations and legislation.\n\nIf e-scooters are allowed on public roads in a community, motor vehicle drivers and\nother road users must learn to share the road with e-scooters. It’s important to know\nthe rules within each community that you drive in. For more information on e-scooters,\nplease visit www.sgi.sk.ca/e-scooters or call our Customer Service Centre at\n1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744).\n\nSharing the road with tow trucksand vehicles rendering assistance on the roadside\nWhen a vehicle used exclusively for towing or\nrendering assistance is stopped on a roadside with\nits amber or amber and blue lights ﬂashing to help a\ndisabled vehicle, drivers must slow to 60 km/h when\npassing. This does not apply to vehicles travelling in\nthe opposite direction on a divided highway. However,\nthis does apply when travelling in the opposite\ndirection on an undivided highway.\n\nSharing the road with funeral processions\nFuneral processions have special privileges and\nshould not be interfered with or interrupted. They\nmust, however, obey all trafﬁc signs and signals –\nunless all drivers with the right of way stop to permit\nthe procession to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.5 The concept of gates\n\n\n\n    3.5 The concept of gates\n    The concept of “gates” is introduced to\n    help you understand how to deal with\n    vehicles around you.\n\n    Imagine four gates surround your\n    vehicle at all times. One gate is located\n    in front of the vehicle, one is behind and\n    one is on each side of the vehicle.\n\n    When you’re travelling alone in the centre lane of a road where there are three lanes\n    provided in the direction you’re travelling, all four gates are open to you. This means\n    you can move ahead, slow down and drop back, or move to your right or left, and still\n    continue uninterrupted movement.\n\n\n\n\n    If a gate is open you can drive into it whenever you want to. A safe driver always tries\n    to have at least two open gates to provide options for emergency movement.\n\n\n\n\n    If a gate is closed – by another vehicle, a curb, a guardrail or even deep snow – you\n    lose the opportunity to move into the area that gate controls.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.5 The concept of gates • 3.6 Blind spots\nCheck your mirrors to ensure you know which gates are open. You need to check\nyour inside mirror and your left outside mirror often. When you’re a more experienced\ndriver, start using your right mirror, if you have one.\n\nWhile you aren’t required to identify a vehicle in detail, you should know whether the\nrear gate is open so that you could drop back if you wished.\n\nIf the vehicle behind you is tailgating, then your rear gate is closed. You need to\nleave extra following distance ahead to allow room if you have to stop. Increase your\nfollowing distance to ﬁve or six seconds (see “Using time to estimate your following\ndistance,” page 87).\n\nHow often you check your mirrors depends upon the number of lanes and the amount\nof trafﬁc. If you’ve ever been surprised by a vehicle overtaking you, then you’re not\nlooking in your mirrors often enough.\n\n\n3.6 Blind spots\nA “blind spot” is an area alongside your vehicle that\nyou can’t see when using any of your mirrors. It’s                BLIND SPOT\nimportant to check these blind spots to ensure your\nside gates are open, particularly if you’re going to\nchange lanes.\n\nA quick glance over your shoulder, or “shoulder\ncheck,” can allow you to see the entire side gate area            BLIND SPOT\nof your vehicle, which could be a blind spot.\nShoulder check your blind spot for the gate you’re driving into. For the left side, turn\nyour head left until you are looking along your shoulder. You’re checking to see if there\nis a vehicle closing your gate. If there is something there, don’t try to move into that\nspace. To check the right side, you need to turn your head to the right.\n\nWatch out for motorcyclists and bicyclists, especially during low light conditions (dusk\nand dawn) or during periods of inclement weather, as these vehicles are small, fast\nand very manoeuvrable and may be easy to miss during a shoulder check.\n\n\n\n\nFor your own safety and the safety of other motorists, don’t drive in other drivers’ blind\nspots. Move forward, or drop back, as soon as you notice this situation.\n\nThe blind spot can be signiﬁcantly reduced if your mirrors are properly adjusted (see\npage 103).\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.7 Directional dividing lines\n\n\n\n    3.7 Directional dividing lines\n    Yellow directional dividing lines separate\n    trafﬁc travelling in opposite directions.\n\n    White line markings are used to separate\n    trafﬁc travelling in the same direction.\n\n    Freeway lanes, as well as some city street\n    lanes, which are ending will usually be\n    marked by double wide lines painted on\n    the pavement. If you’re driving in a lane\n    marked with double wide lines, be\n    prepared for the lane to end. You’ll have to\n    exit the freeway, turn at the next intersection,\n    or merge. Look for signs.\n\n\n\n\n    Vehicle A may pass if the road is clear ahead and behind.\n\n\n\n\n    Vehicle A must not pass or make a left turn between intersections.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.8 Trafﬁc Lanes • 3.9 Lane position • 3.10 Lane selection\n3.8 Trafﬁc lanes\nOn roads with marked lanes, you must travel entirely in one lane. Where there are no\nlane lines marked, you should travel as if there were markings there. Changing lanes is\npermitted only when safe to do so.\n\nWhere a solid line separates lanes, you may not move across the solid line. The only\nexceptions are double lines in the centre of a highway where the line nearest you is a\nbroken line (see the preceding illustrations) or centre turning lanes .\n\n\n3.9 Lane position\nOn highways or rural roads, keep to the right of your lane.\n\nIn urban areas, you’ll usually drive in the middle of the lane. However, your position in\nthe lane should allow you to see as much as possible.\n\nYour lane position provides information to other drivers. If you intend to turn left, move\nto the left side of the lane. If you’re going to turn right, move to the right side of the\nlane, but be careful to leave enough room for passing parked vehicles.\n\nAt some intersections, signs or trafﬁc lights indicate two or more lanes may be used\nto complete a turn. At these locations, you must approach the intersection and\ncomplete the turn in the same relative lane position.\n\n\n\n\n3.10 Lane selection\nChoose the driving lane that gives you the best vision and allows you to keep the\nmaximum number of gates open.\n\n• On slippery surfaces, pick the part of the lane that offers the most traction.\n• When turning at intersections, choose the lane that the law says you must take (see\n  “Turning,” page 41). On a divided highway use the left lane to approach a left turn\n  off the highway.\n• On a multi-lane divided highway the left lane is intended for vehicles to pass slower\n  moving right lane vehicles or for emergency vehicles. The maximum speed posted\n  is the maximum under ideal road conditions. See page 117 for safe merging on a\n  freeway.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.10 Lane selection • 3.11 Signalling\n\n\n\n    It’s not a good practice to drive on the shoulder portion of the road. The area of the\n    roadway to the right of the solid white line is designed for stopped vehicles. As well,\n    the shoulder can be used for emergency manoeuvres, or preparing to make a right\n    turn from a highway. The shoulder is not an extra driving lane. Some highways have\n    rumble strips on the shoulder, and in some cases on the centre line, to alert drivers\n    when they drift out of their lane.\n\n\n    3.11 Signalling\n    You must turn on your signal lights in advance of your turn or lane change. A good\n    rule when driving at speeds under 60 km/h is to signal at least 30 m before turning.\n    At higher speeds, signal at least 150 m from the corner.\n\n    When changing lanes, you must signal and do mirror and shoulder checks before you\n    begin to move out of your lane.\n\n    If your signal lights or brake lights fail, these hand signals must be used.\n\n\n\n\n    Left turn                       Right turn                   Stopping or slowing abruptly\n\n    Turn signals\n    When you use turn signals, you’re saying, “I intend to turn or change lanes.” If you\n    wait until you’re actually turning or changing lanes before you signal, you’re not telling\n    other drivers what you intend to do. They can already see that you’re turning.\n\n    The procedure when you plan to turn or change lanes:\n    1. Assuming that you know the status of your gates and are properly positioned for\n       the turn, signal.\n    2. Check your mirror.\n    3. Shoulder check your blind spot for the gate you are moving into.\n    4. Start the turn or lane change.\n    5. Cancel signal once turn or lane change is complete.\n\n    If you are approaching an intersection and want to change lanes, complete your lane\n    change and cancel your signal before entering the intersection or wait until you pass\n    through the intersection before turning on your signal and changing lanes. This helps\n    to keep intersections safer and avoid confusion.\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.12 Changing lanes • 3.13 Passing\n3.12 Changing lanes\nThe procedure for changing lanes:\n1. Determine the need to change lanes well in advance. Make sure you know the\n   conditions of your gate.\n2. Signal your intention to change lanes.\n3. Check your mirrors to see that the gate is open and that no one else is moving into it.\n4. Shoulder check to look for vehicles or obstructions in your blind spot.\n5. Look where you want the vehicle to go and steer there.\n6. Accelerate gently and steer the vehicle to the position where you’re looking.\n7. When you’re almost completely in the new lane, look ahead to the point where you\n   intend to drive and your steering will adjust.\n8. Cancel signal. Check the condition of your new gates. Adjust your speed.\n\n\n\n\nWhen moving through more than a single lane, make the change as one continual\naction. Only one signal is required, and don’t forget to shoulder check.\n\n\n3.13 Passing\nWhen meeting other vehicles, you must keep to the right of the centre line of the\nroadway.\n\nHead-on collisions are usually fatal. Driver distraction (e.g., texting/talking on a\ncellphone, eating, etc.), driver impairment (fatigue, alcohol, drugs) or driver errors,\nsuch as faulty judgment or techniques while passing, are often contributing factors in\nthese collisions..\n\nWhen passing, it’s very important to keep the time spent on the wrong side of the\nroad to a bare minimum.\n\nWhen passing:\n1. Make sure the pass is legal, safe and necessary. Don’t cross solid or double solid\n   yellow lines. Don’t pass on the crest of a hill, before a curve, at intersections or any\n   place where your sight distance is limited.\n2. Maintain a minimum three-second following distance between you and the vehicle\n   you are following (see “Using time to estimate your following distance,”\n   page 87). When you decide to pass, accelerate to build up speed before\n   passing. The greater the difference in speed between you and the vehicle you’re\n   passing, the shorter your passing time will be.\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.13 Passing\n\n\n\n    3. Continue to accelerate throughout the entire pass. Don’t slow down until you’re\n       back in your original lane and well in front of the vehicle you just passed. Keep in\n       mind that it’s illegal to speed even when passing.\n    4. Wait until you see the vehicle being passed in your inside rear-view mirror before\n       pulling back into your travelling lane. Remember, you must signal, check your\n       mirrors and shoulder check to ensure it’s safe to re-enter your travelling lane.\n\n    Note: At high speeds, the lane change is more gradual and takes longer to complete.\n\n    When passing other vehicles, you must always pass on the left except:\n    • where there are two or more trafﬁc lanes in your direction of travel\n    • any time the vehicle ahead is about to make a left turn and it is possible to pass\n      safely on the right without driving on the shoulder\n\n    You may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an intersection to permit pedestrians to\n    cross.\n\n    When being passed on the left by another vehicle, stay to the right of your lane and\n    maintain your speed. Don’t accelerate or obstruct the passing vehicle from returning\n    to the right lane.\n\n    Passing Lanes\n    Passing lanes are designed to allow vehicles to pass safely and improve the ﬂow of\n    trafﬁc. A passing lane is an additional lane added to a highway that permits a slower\n    vehicle to move into the right hand lane, while a faster vehicle can pass safely in the\n    left hand lane.\n\n    The right hand lane is designated for travel and the left hand lane is only to be used\n    for passing. Maintain your speed when moving into the right hand lane and do not\n    speed up.\n\n    Signs will alert you of a passing lane ahead. Have patience, maintain a safe following\n    distance and wait for the passing lane instead of using the oncoming trafﬁc lane,\n    which can be dangerous.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes\n3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes\nMajor centres often have designated bus and/or bicycle lanes\nthat other motorists must stay out of unless they need to\nenter them to turn, park or for entering a lane or driveway.\n\nBus lanes are marked by a lane sign that indicates the time\nand days of operation of the restriction. The sign has a\ndiamond on it, as well as a bus symbol. In some centres, the\nlane itself has diamond markings installed in the pavement.\nOn these designated streets, curb lanes are reserved for\ntransit vehicles during the rush hour, or peak driving times.\nWhen bus lane hours are in effect, no one is allowed to operate a vehicle, other than\na bus or an emergency vehicle, in the designated curb lane, except for the purpose\nof making a right turn onto, or off of, a street block where a bus lane is in effect.\nOnly buses, emergency vehicles or accessible taxicabs loading or unloading non-\nambulatory passengers are allowed to stop in a designated bus lane.\n\n\n\n\nThis sign indicates the\nstreet you’re turning to has a\ndesignated lane.\n\n                                                                    Bicycle lane\n\n\nBicycle-only lanes are dedicated for cyclists and are similar to bus lanes. Vehicles\naren’t allowed in bicycle-only lanes except for the purpose of making a right turn,\naccessing a parking space or entering a lane or driveway.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes\n\n\n\n      Exclusive bicycle lanes                       Shared bicycle lanes\n\n\n\n\n    Designated bicycle lanes may be exclusive for bicycle use (left) or shared with motor\n    vehicle trafﬁc (right).\n\n    Pavement marking may vary between communities.\n\n    Shared bicycle lanes\n    A chevron and bicycle symbol designate a shared bicycle or “sharrow” lane.\n\n    Sharrows use pavement markings painted on a roadways to encourage cyclists and\n    motorists to share the lane. They are generally intended for use on roadways with\n    lanes that are wide enough for side-by-side bicycle and vehicle operation. However,\n    motorists should always pass cyclists at a safe distance and should not assume that\n    the sharrow indicates that they can pass within the travel lane. Depending on the\n    positioning of the cyclist, it may be necessary to change lanes in order to pass safely.\n\n    Sharrows do not designate a bicycle lane and should not be treated as such. While\n    some cyclists will ride down the centre of the arrow, in many locations, the sharrow\n    marking simply indicates cyclists and motorists are to share the lane and isn’t an\n    indication of where a cyclist rides within the lane.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.15 Turning\n3.15 Turning\nRight turns\nWhen approaching an intersection or driveway that requires a right-hand turn, move\nas close to the right curb or right edge of the road as possible.\n\nGeneral procedure:\n1. Plan your right turn well in advance. Signal, check your rear gate and check your\n   blind spot. When safe, move as close to the right as possible.\n2. Check for trafﬁc, pedestrians and other real or potential hazards in or near the\n   intersection. A basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping pattern will be\n   sufﬁcient.\n3. Slow down (shift to a lower gear if driving a manual transmission vehicle). Maintain\n   a suitable speed throughout the turn to allow for proper vehicle control and avoid\n   obstructing trafﬁc.\n4. Check again for real or potential hazards.\n5. If there are no real or potential hazards, complete your right turn into the ﬁrst\n   available driving lane.\n\nSee page 79 for rules regarding turning right on a red light.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.15 Turning\n\n\n\n    When a vehicle is parked in the lane closest to the right curb and near the\n    intersection, the driver must move into that lane at the ﬁrst opportunity before turning,\n    keeping as close to the right curb or edge of the road as possible.\n\n    Drivers may not make turns from the main driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n         Incorrect                                   Correct\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.15 Turning\nLeft turns\nLeft turns are more dangerous than right turns because you have to cross trafﬁc\ncoming from at least two directions. This means that your searching pattern is very\nimportant and you should continue to search as you cross the intersection. When\nyou intend to turn left across the path of any vehicle approaching from the opposite\ndirection, you must yield the right of way to the oncoming vehicle. When making a left\nturn, you must approach the intersection and complete the turn in the left-most lane\navailable for your direction of travel.\n\nGeneral procedure:\n1. If a lane change is required, decide well in advance to make your left turn. Signal\n   and check your rear gate and blind spot to see if there is a vehicle close to you.\n   Move safely into the left side of the left lane.\n2. Check for trafﬁc, pedestrians and any other real or potential hazards that may be\n   in or near the intersection. Use the basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping\n   pattern.\n3. Slow down (and shift to a lower gear if you are driving a manual transmission\n   vehicle).\n4. Check again for real or potential hazards. Watch out for motorcycles when\n   completing a left turn. Motorists failing to identify oncoming motorcycles when\n   making a left turn is a signiﬁcant contributing factor in collisions involving\n   motorcycles.\n5. If you have to stop in the intersection to wait for oncoming trafﬁc, be sure to keep\n   your vehicle parallel to the lane and your front wheels straight. That way if you’re hit\n   from behind, you will not be pushed in the path of oncoming trafﬁc.\n6. If there are no potential hazards, complete your left turn into the ﬁrst available\n   driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.15 Turning\n\n\n\n    A left turn from a one-way street to a two-way street should be made as close as\n    possible to the left edge of the roadway. If there are no cars parked in the curb lane,\n    you can move into that lane in advance of the corner. If there is a car in the curb lane,\n    be sure the driver is turning and not pulling over to park before entering the lane.\n\n    When you make your turn onto the two-way street, enter into the lane immediately to\n    the right of the centre line.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.15 Turning\nFor a left turn from a one-way street to a one-way street, start the turn from the left\nedge of the roadway and complete the turn in the left-most driving lane.\n\nWhen a vehicle is parked in a lane closest to the left curb and near the intersection,\nthe driver must move into that lane at the ﬁrst opportunity before turning.\n\n\n\n\nFor a left turn from a two-way street to a one-way street, turn from the lane next to the\ncentre line and enter the one-way street into the left-most driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.16 Centre turning lanes\n\n\n\n    3.16 Centre turning lanes\n    This sign indicates a two-way left turning lane. These are\n    used in many communities, especially larger centres,\n    to improve trafﬁc ﬂow and to allow for easier access to\n    properties in mid-block.\n\n    The diagram indicates the correct turning procedure. Here are\n    some other points to keep in mind when using centre turning\n    lanes:\n    • Enter the two-way left turning\n      lane only at the point adjacent\n      to the property you want to\n      access (see arrow for car A).\n    • Left turns from either direction\n      may be made from the two-way\n      left turning lane.\n    • When leaving a driveway or\n      parking lot, pick a gap in trafﬁc,\n      complete the turn by driving\n      through the centre turning\n                                            B\n      lane and into the ﬁrst available\n      driving lane as quickly as\n      possible (see arrow for car B).\n    • The centre turning lanes may\n      not be used as a passing lane\n      or as a driving lane.\n    • Where a centre turning lane is\n      provided, you may not make a\n      left turn from any other lane.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    A\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.17 Right of way\n3.17 Right of way\nUncontrolled intersections\nAt an intersection where there are no stop signs, yield signs, trafﬁc lights or police\ndirecting trafﬁc, and two vehicles arrive at the intersection at approximately the same\ntime, the driver of the vehicle on the left must yield the right of way to the driver of the\nvehicle on the right.\n\n\n\n\nThis rule also applies to T-intersections.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.17 Right of way\n\n\n\n    When turning left, you must yield the right of way to any vehicles coming toward you if\n    they are close enough that your turn would interfere with them.\n\n\n\n\n    When entering a provincial highway from any other road, you must yield the right of\n    way to any vehicles travelling on the provincial highway and to any pedestrian closely\n    approaching the intersection.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.17 Right of way\nWhen entering a street, road or highway from a private road, lane or alley, you must\nyield the right of way to any pedestrians on the sidewalk and to any vehicles on the\nstreet, road or highway.\n\n\n\n\nControlled intersections\nAt any intersection where a yield sign is present, drivers facing the sign must yield the\nright of way to any other motorist approaching the intersection.\n\nAt three and four-way stops, courtesy dictates that the ﬁrst vehicle that stops should\nbe given the right of way. The remaining three then yield the right of way to the driver\non their right.\n\nAt two-way stops, vehicles must remain stopped until all cross trafﬁc passes. When\ntwo vehicles arrive around the same time to the opposite stop signs and one of the\nvehicles is turning left, the driver turning left must yield the right of way to the driver\ngoing straight. If it’s safe, the vehicle turning left can go next, even if another vehicle\narrives in the meantime, and plans to go straight. The left turning vehicle can turn\nleft while the next vehicle advances to the stop line. This keeps trafﬁc ﬂowing. When\nopposing vehicles are both going straight, the drivers can proceed at the same time.\n\nIn any case, if you’re at a stop sign you must yield to vehicles and pedestrians and\nmay not proceed until it’s safe.\n\nAll drivers have a moral and legal responsibility to avoid collisions. If you have the right\nof way at an intersection and a driver refuses to yield to you, you’re responsible from\na safety standpoint to avoid a collision, rather than insist upon your right of way. Don’t\nforget the old adage – “You could be right – dead right.”\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.17 Right of way\n\n\n\n    Construction or maintenance vehicles\n    At all times, you must yield the right of way to any highway construction or\n    maintenance vehicles that have their warning lights ﬂashing.\n\n    Zipper merge\n    When a lane is closed in a construction zone, you might need to make a zipper\n    merge. A zipper merge means drivers use both lanes of trafﬁc until the lane ends,\n    and then alternate in “zipper” fashion into the open lane. Vehicles in the lane that’s\n    ending must signal, shoulder check and merge when safe, while each driver in the\n    continuing lane should let one vehicle in. Sometimes both lanes are merging into\n    a new lane and drivers in both lanes must signal, shoulder check and take turns\n    merging when it’s safe.\n\n    Zipper merging is beneﬁcial because it makes trafﬁc ﬂow more quickly and efﬁciently\n    for drivers in both lanes. It also creates a sense of fairness and equity since all lanes\n    are moving at the same rate. Zipper merging also helps reduce:\n    • differences in speeds between two lanes\n    • the overall length of trafﬁc backup\n    • congestion on freeway interchanges\n\n\n\n\n    Always pay attention and follow any posted signs you see in a construction area.\n    Zipper merge signs may not always be present, but zipper merging is allowed and\n    recommended in construction zones.\n\n    Remember to be courteous, merge when safe and you’ll zip through quickly.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.18 Stopping positions\n3.18 Stopping positions\nThere are several different situations you may see when preparing to stop at an\nintersection with a stop sign or trafﬁc light. Where you should stop and your stopping\nposition, is determined by markings on the road. You must stop:\n\n\n\n\nAt the nearest crosswalk,      At a clearly marked        Where there is no stop line,\nwhether marked or not.         stop line.                 sidewalk or crosswalk:\n                                                          • Within three metres of the\n                                                             intersection in a town, city,\n                                                             village or hamlet.\n                                                          • Within 10 metres of the\n                                                            intersection in a rural area.\n\n\n\n\nBehind the clearly marked X.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.19 Interchanges\n\n\n\n    3.19 Interchanges\n    Roundabouts\n    In a roundabout, the vehicle on the right must yield to the vehicle on the left.\n\n    In the diagram, trafﬁc indicated by red arrows in yellow lanes must yield to trafﬁc\n    indicated by white arrows in green lanes. Trafﬁc entering the roundabout must yield to\n    trafﬁc in the roundabout.\n\n    In this diagram:\n    • B and C must yield to A.\n    • E must yield to D while F and D proceed.\n    • H must yield to G.\n\n\n\n\n    When you’re leaving the roundabout use your right-turn signal to warn other drivers of\n    your intention to exit.\n\n    It’s recommended that for safety, entry into the right lane be used mainly when\n    intending to exit at the ﬁrst available exit point. If you are intending to proceed beyond\n    the second exit, you should drive in the left lane.\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.19 Interchanges\nDiverging Diamond Interchange\nA diverging diamond interchange is new to Saskatchewan, but is gaining popularity\nacross North America. This type of interchange is designed to improve safety and\nreduce delays by maintaining the ﬂow of trafﬁc. The key feature of this type of\ninterchange is that trafﬁc on the overpass crosses over to the opposite side of the\nroad at one trafﬁc-signal controlled ramp and then returns to the proper side at the\nnext trafﬁc-signal controlled ramp. The crossover allows higher volume left-turn trafﬁc\nto proceed with little disruption or interruption.\n\nWhen you encounter this type of intersection:\n• Watch for lane designation signs as well as pavement markings to guide you into the\n  correct lane (see “Lane selection,”page 35).\n• Trafﬁc going straight – watch for lane designation signs and ensure you’re in the\n  correct lane to proceed straight. After the trafﬁc lights, don’t panic; you will be\n  crossing onto the opposite side of the road for a short distance before crossing\n  back onto the proper side at the next trafﬁc lights.\n• Trafﬁc turning left – watch for lane designation signs and ensure you’re in the\n  correct lane to turn left. After the trafﬁc lights, don’t panic; you will be crossing onto\n  the opposite side of the road for a short distance before making your left turn.\n• Trafﬁc turning right – normal right-hand turn procedures apply, so watch for lane\n  designation signs and ensure you’re in the correct lane to turn right.\n\n\n\n\nTrafﬁc going straight\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.19 Interchanges\n\n\n\n\n    Trafﬁc turning left\n\n\n\n\n    Trafﬁc turning right\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.19 Interchanges\nRestricted Crossing U-Turn\nThe Restricted Crossing U-Turn (RCUT)\nintersection (also known as a reduced\nconﬂict intersection) is designed to\ndecrease collisions caused by motorists\nattempting to cross a four-lane divided\nhighway.\n\nAt an RCUT intersection, drivers always\nmake a right turn, followed by a U-turn.\nMotorists approaching a divided highway\nwith an RCUT intersection are not allowed\nto make a left turn or drive straight through\nto cross the divided highway. Instead,\ndrivers must do the following:\n\n1. Using the entrance ramp, make a right\n   turn into the acceleration lane to enter\n   the highway.\n2. When it is safe to do so, signal, check\n   your mirrors, shoulder check and\n   change lanes into the far-left lane to\n   enter the U-turn lane.\n\n\n\n\n3. Complete the U-turn into the\n   acceleration lane going the opposite\n   direction.\n4. When it is safe to do so, signal, check\n   your mirrors, shoulder check and\n   change lanes into the far right driving\n   lane to continue straight or into the far\n   right turning lane to complete a right\n   turn.\n5. Remember to shoulder check when\n   changing multiple lanes.\n\n\n\n\n             This is a general representation\n              of the intersection.

        "content": "    When a motorcycle and a four-wheel vehicle collide,\n    the motorcyclist is at a high risk for being killed or\n    severely injured. Since motorcycles are more agile\n    than cars, their actions are more difﬁcult to predict and\n    their size makes them hard to see.\n\n    Most motorcycles are wired so that their headlights\n    are on at all times, making it easier for you to see\n    them. Be alert for motorcycles that don’t have their\n    headlights on. During motorcycle season, check twice\n    before making a lane change or turn – once for cars\n    and trucks, and once for motorcycles and bikes.\n\n    When passing a motorcycle, ensure you leave adequate distance ahead of the\n    motorcycle before you pull back in to the lane. Failure to leave sufﬁcient room can be\n    extremely dangerous for the motorcyclist.\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.4 Sharing the road\nThe same three-second following distance should be given to motorcycles as is given\nto other vehicles. Following too closely may cause a motorcycle rider’s attention to be\ndistracted from the road and trafﬁc ahead.\n\nMotorcyclists are allowed to ride two abreast but most riders prefer to have a full\nlane width. A skilled motorcyclist is constantly changing positions within a lane to\nincrease his ability to see and be seen, and to avoid objects on the road. Never move\ninto the same lane beside a motorcycle, even if the lane is wide and the motorcyclist\nis riding to one side. It is not only illegal, it’s extremely hazardous. When overtaking a\nmotorcycle or bicycle in your lane, you must pass in the same manner as you would\npass a car.\n\nBad weather and slippery surfaces cause greater problems for motorcycles than for\ncars. Allow more following distance for motorcycles when the road surface is wet and\nslippery. These conditions create stability problems.\n\nBeing aware of these situations can help you share the road safely with all cyclists.\n\nNew motorcyclists are required to display a\nMotorcycle Graduated Driver Licensing (MGDL)\nplacard on their licence plate identifying them\nas new riders. Learners are required to display\na red ‘L’ placard and Novice riders must display\ngreen ‘N’ placards. Please use caution when\npassing or following a new rider and give them\nplenty of space.\n\n\nSharing the road with bicycles\nBicycles are vehicles too and entitled to their\nshare of the road. More people are using them for\ntransportation, recreation, physical ﬁtness, and to\nreduce emissions. Cyclists must obey the same rules\nof the road as other vehicles.\n\nCyclists travelling at a lower speed than other trafﬁc\nare expected to ride about one metre from the curb or\nparked cars, or as close as practical to the right-hand\nedge of the road when there is no curb.\n• Cyclists are not required to ride close to the right edge of the road when they are\n  travelling at or faster than the normal speed of trafﬁc at that time and place, or when\n  they are turning left, or getting in position to turn left.\nBike lanes are reserved for cyclists. Sometimes you will need to enter or cross a bike\nlane to turn right at a corner or driveway. Take extra care when you do this. Enter the\nbike lane only after ensuring that you can do so safely, and then make the turn.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.4 Sharing the road\n\n\n\n    When you’re sharing the road with cyclists please remember:\n    • Many children riding bicycles on the street are very young and lack the necessary\n      training and skills for safe cycling.\n    • When passing or overtaking a cyclist, go around them like you would any other\n      vehicle.\n    • Watch for cyclists’ hand signals. A cyclist may indicate a right-hand turn by extending\n      their right arm. If possible, try to make eye contact with cyclists.\n    • When turning left, you must stop and wait for oncoming bicycles to pass before\n      turning.\n    • When driving through an intersection, be careful to scan for cyclists waiting to turn\n      left.\n    • When you’re preparing to make a right turn, watch for cyclists who may pull up\n      alongside your vehicle. Check your blind spots.\n    • When making a right turn, do not pull up beside a cyclist and then turn directly in front\n      of them and cut them off.\n    • When pulling away from the curb always check for cyclists who may be travelling near\n      the right edge of the lane or curb.\n    • When parked at the curb, always check for cyclists when you open your vehicle door.\n    • Give cyclists space with a safe following distance. They do not have brake lights to\n      warn you when they’re slowing or stopping.\n    • Cyclists are entitled to make left turns the same way as motorists. Since they\n      are exposed on left turns, they will need extra consideration, especially on\n      multi-lane roads.\n    • It’s easy to misjudge the speed of bicycles — they can travel faster than you think!\n      Experienced cyclists can travel at 25-35 km/h on a ﬂat surface and up to 50km/h\n      going downhill.\n    • Cyclists are entitled to ride at least one metre from the curb and may ride even further\n      out when they steer away from drainage grates, potholes, debris, loose gravel or sand,\n      wet or slippery surfaces, rutted or grooved pavement and even dogs. Be aware of the\n      roadway conditions that may affect a cyclist.\n    • Don’t use your horn when you’re passing a cyclist. It may frighten them and cause\n      them to steer into your path. If you feel that you must use your horn, tap it quickly and\n      lightly while you are still some distance away from the cyclist.\n    There’s also a class of bicycle called power-assisted bicycles, commonly known as\n    e-bikes or electric bicycles and many are designed to look like scooters equipped\n    with pedals. These types of vehicles use an electric motor to help the operator up to a\n    maximum speed of 32 km/h. Treat them the same way you would any other cyclist.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.4 Sharing the road\nSharing the road with e-scooters\n(electric kick scooters)\nE-scooters (also known as electric kick scooters or\nelectric scooters) are known as limited speed motor\nvehicles and are permitted in communities, towns, or\ncities that have speciﬁc e-scooter bylaws in place.

It’s important to know\nthe rules within each community that you drive in.

This does not apply to vehicles travelling in\nthe opposite direction on a divided highway. However,\nthis does apply when travelling in the opposite\ndirection on an undivided highway.\n\nSharing the road with funeral processions\nFuneral processions have special privileges and\nshould not be interfered with or interrupted. They\nmust, however, obey all trafﬁc signs and signals –\nunless all drivers with the right of way stop to permit\nthe procession to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.5 The concept of gates\n\n\n\n    3.5 The concept of gates\n    The concept of “gates” is introduced to\n    help you understand how to deal with\n    vehicles around you.\n\n    Imagine four gates surround your\n    vehicle at all times. One gate is located\n    in front of the vehicle, one is behind and\n    one is on each side of the vehicle.\n\n    When you’re travelling alone in the centre lane of a road where there are three lanes\n    provided in the direction you’re travelling, all four gates are open to you. This means\n    you can move ahead, slow down and drop back, or move to your right or left, and still\n    continue uninterrupted movement.\n\n\n\n\n    If a gate is open you can drive into it whenever you want to. A safe driver always tries\n    to have at least two open gates to provide options for emergency movement.\n\n\n\n\n    If a gate is closed – by another vehicle, a curb, a guardrail or even deep snow – you\n    lose the opportunity to move into the area that gate controls.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.5 The concept of gates • 3.6 Blind spots\nCheck your mirrors to ensure you know which gates are open. You need to check\nyour inside mirror and your left outside mirror often. When you’re a more experienced\ndriver, start using your right mirror, if you have one.\n\nWhile you aren’t required to identify a vehicle in detail, you should know whether the\nrear gate is open so that you could drop back if you wished.\n\nIf the vehicle behind you is tailgating, then your rear gate is closed. You need to\nleave extra following distance ahead to allow room if you have to stop. Increase your\nfollowing distance to ﬁve or six seconds (see “Using time to estimate your following\ndistance,” page 87).\n\nHow often you check your mirrors depends upon the number of lanes and the amount\nof trafﬁc. If you’ve ever been surprised by a vehicle overtaking you, then you’re not\nlooking in your mirrors often enough.\n\n\n3.6 Blind spots\nA “blind spot” is an area alongside your vehicle that\nyou can’t see when using any of your mirrors. It’s                BLIND SPOT\nimportant to check these blind spots to ensure your\nside gates are open, particularly if you’re going to\nchange lanes.\n\nA quick glance over your shoulder, or “shoulder\ncheck,” can allow you to see the entire side gate area            BLIND SPOT\nof your vehicle, which could be a blind spot.\nShoulder check your blind spot for the gate you’re driving into. For the left side, turn\nyour head left until you are looking along your shoulder. You’re checking to see if there\nis a vehicle closing your gate. If there is something there, don’t try to move into that\nspace. To check the right side, you need to turn your head to the right.\n\nWatch out for motorcyclists and bicyclists, especially during low light conditions (dusk\nand dawn) or during periods of inclement weather, as these vehicles are small, fast\nand very manoeuvrable and may be easy to miss during a shoulder check.\n\n\n\n\nFor your own safety and the safety of other motorists, don’t drive in other drivers’ blind\nspots. Move forward, or drop back, as soon as you notice this situation.\n\nThe blind spot can be signiﬁcantly reduced if your mirrors are properly adjusted (see\npage 103).\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.7 Directional dividing lines\n\n\n\n    3.7 Directional dividing lines\n    Yellow directional dividing lines separate\n    trafﬁc travelling in opposite directions.\n\n    White line markings are used to separate\n    trafﬁc travelling in the same direction.\n\n    Freeway lanes, as well as some city street\n    lanes, which are ending will usually be\n    marked by double wide lines painted on\n    the pavement. If you’re driving in a lane\n    marked with double wide lines, be\n    prepared for the lane to end. You’ll have to\n    exit the freeway, turn at the next intersection,\n    or merge. Look for signs.\n\n\n\n\n    Vehicle A may pass if the road is clear ahead and behind.\n\n\n\n\n    Vehicle A must not pass or make a left turn between intersections.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.8 Trafﬁc Lanes • 3.9 Lane position • 3.10 Lane selection\n3.8 Trafﬁc lanes\nOn roads with marked lanes, you must travel entirely in one lane. Where there are no\nlane lines marked, you should travel as if there were markings there. Changing lanes is\npermitted only when safe to do so.\n\nWhere a solid line separates lanes, you may not move across the solid line. The only\nexceptions are double lines in the centre of a highway where the line nearest you is a\nbroken line (see the preceding illustrations) or centre turning lanes .\n\n\n3.9 Lane position\nOn highways or rural roads, keep to the right of your lane.\n\nIn urban areas, you’ll usually drive in the middle of the lane. However, your position in\nthe lane should allow you to see as much as possible.\n\nYour lane position provides information to other drivers. If you intend to turn left, move\nto the left side of the lane. If you’re going to turn right, move to the right side of the\nlane, but be careful to leave enough room for passing parked vehicles.\n\nAt some intersections, signs or trafﬁc lights indicate two or more lanes may be used\nto complete a turn. At these locations, you must approach the intersection and\ncomplete the turn in the same relative lane position.\n\n\n\n\n3.10 Lane selection\nChoose the driving lane that gives you the best vision and allows you to keep the\nmaximum number of gates open.\n\n• On slippery surfaces, pick the part of the lane that offers the most traction.\n• When turning at intersections, choose the lane that the law says you must take (see\n  “Turning,” page 41). On a divided highway use the left lane to approach a left turn\n  off the highway.\n• On a multi-lane divided highway the left lane is intended for vehicles to pass slower\n  moving right lane vehicles or for emergency vehicles. The maximum speed posted\n  is the maximum under ideal road conditions. See page 117 for safe merging on a\n  freeway.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.10 Lane selection • 3.11 Signalling\n\n\n\n    It’s not a good practice to drive on the shoulder portion of the road. The area of the\n    roadway to the right of the solid white line is designed for stopped vehicles. As well,\n    the shoulder can be used for emergency manoeuvres, or preparing to make a right\n    turn from a highway. The shoulder is not an extra driving lane. Some highways have\n    rumble strips on the shoulder, and in some cases on the centre line, to alert drivers\n    when they drift out of their lane.\n\n\n    3.11 Signalling\n    You must turn on your signal lights in advance of your turn or lane change. A good\n    rule when driving at speeds under 60 km/h is to signal at least 30 m before turning.\n    At higher speeds, signal at least 150 m from the corner.\n\n    When changing lanes, you must signal and do mirror and shoulder checks before you\n    begin to move out of your lane.\n\n    If your signal lights or brake lights fail, these hand signals must be used.\n\n\n\n\n    Left turn                       Right turn                   Stopping or slowing abruptly\n\n    Turn signals\n    When you use turn signals, you’re saying, “I intend to turn or change lanes.” If you\n    wait until you’re actually turning or changing lanes before you signal, you’re not telling\n    other drivers what you intend to do. They can already see that you’re turning.\n\n    The procedure when you plan to turn or change lanes:\n    1. Assuming that you know the status of your gates and are properly positioned for\n       the turn, signal.\n    2. Check your mirror.\n    3. Shoulder check your blind spot for the gate you are moving into.\n    4. Start the turn or lane change.\n    5. Cancel signal once turn or lane change is complete.\n\n    If you are approaching an intersection and want to change lanes, complete your lane\n    change and cancel your signal before entering the intersection or wait until you pass\n    through the intersection before turning on your signal and changing lanes. This helps\n    to keep intersections safer and avoid confusion.\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.12 Changing lanes • 3.13 Passing\n3.12 Changing lanes\nThe procedure for changing lanes:\n1. Determine the need to change lanes well in advance. Make sure you know the\n   conditions of your gate.\n2. Signal your intention to change lanes.\n3. Check your mirrors to see that the gate is open and that no one else is moving into it.\n4. Shoulder check to look for vehicles or obstructions in your blind spot.\n5. Look where you want the vehicle to go and steer there.\n6. Accelerate gently and steer the vehicle to the position where you’re looking.\n7. When you’re almost completely in the new lane, look ahead to the point where you\n   intend to drive and your steering will adjust.\n8. Cancel signal. Check the condition of your new gates. Adjust your speed.\n\n\n\n\nWhen moving through more than a single lane, make the change as one continual\naction. Only one signal is required, and don’t forget to shoulder check.\n\n\n3.13 Passing\nWhen meeting other vehicles, you must keep to the right of the centre line of the\nroadway.\n\nHead-on collisions are usually fatal. Driver distraction (e.g., texting/talking on a\ncellphone, eating, etc.), driver impairment (fatigue, alcohol, drugs) or driver errors,\nsuch as faulty judgment or techniques while passing, are often contributing factors in\nthese collisions..\n\nWhen passing, it’s very important to keep the time spent on the wrong side of the\nroad to a bare minimum.\n\nWhen passing:\n1. Make sure the pass is legal, safe and necessary. Don’t cross solid or double solid\n   yellow lines. Don’t pass on the crest of a hill, before a curve, at intersections or any\n   place where your sight distance is limited.\n2. Maintain a minimum three-second following distance between you and the vehicle\n   you are following (see “Using time to estimate your following distance,”\n   page 87). When you decide to pass, accelerate to build up speed before\n   passing. The greater the difference in speed between you and the vehicle you’re\n   passing, the shorter your passing time will be.\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.13 Passing\n\n\n\n    3. Continue to accelerate throughout the entire pass. Don’t slow down until you’re\n       back in your original lane and well in front of the vehicle you just passed. Keep in\n       mind that it’s illegal to speed even when passing.\n    4. Wait until you see the vehicle being passed in your inside rear-view mirror before\n       pulling back into your travelling lane. Remember, you must signal, check your\n       mirrors and shoulder check to ensure it’s safe to re-enter your travelling lane.\n\n    Note: At high speeds, the lane change is more gradual and takes longer to complete.\n\n    When passing other vehicles, you must always pass on the left except:\n    • where there are two or more trafﬁc lanes in your direction of travel\n    • any time the vehicle ahead is about to make a left turn and it is possible to pass\n      safely on the right without driving on the shoulder\n\n    You may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an intersection to permit pedestrians to\n    cross.\n\n    When being passed on the left by another vehicle, stay to the right of your lane and\n    maintain your speed. Don’t accelerate or obstruct the passing vehicle from returning\n    to the right lane.\n\n    Passing Lanes\n    Passing lanes are designed to allow vehicles to pass safely and improve the ﬂow of\n    trafﬁc. A passing lane is an additional lane added to a highway that permits a slower\n    vehicle to move into the right hand lane, while a faster vehicle can pass safely in the\n    left hand lane.\n\n    The right hand lane is designated for travel and the left hand lane is only to be used\n    for passing. Maintain your speed when moving into the right hand lane and do not\n    speed up.\n\n    Signs will alert you of a passing lane ahead. Have patience, maintain a safe following\n    distance and wait for the passing lane instead of using the oncoming trafﬁc lane,\n    which can be dangerous.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes\n3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes\nMajor centres often have designated bus and/or bicycle lanes\nthat other motorists must stay out of unless they need to\nenter them to turn, park or for entering a lane or driveway.\n\nBus lanes are marked by a lane sign that indicates the time\nand days of operation of the restriction. The sign has a\ndiamond on it, as well as a bus symbol. In some centres, the\nlane itself has diamond markings installed in the pavement.\nOn these designated streets, curb lanes are reserved for\ntransit vehicles during the rush hour, or peak driving times.\nWhen bus lane hours are in effect, no one is allowed to operate a vehicle, other than\na bus or an emergency vehicle, in the designated curb lane, except for the purpose\nof making a right turn onto, or off of, a street block where a bus lane is in effect.\nOnly buses, emergency vehicles or accessible taxicabs loading or unloading non-\nambulatory passengers are allowed to stop in a designated bus lane.\n\n\n\n\nThis sign indicates the\nstreet you’re turning to has a\ndesignated lane.\n\n                                                                    Bicycle lane\n\n\nBicycle-only lanes are dedicated for cyclists and are similar to bus lanes. Vehicles\naren’t allowed in bicycle-only lanes except for the purpose of making a right turn,\naccessing a parking space or entering a lane or driveway.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes\n\n\n\n      Exclusive bicycle lanes                       Shared bicycle lanes\n\n\n\n\n    Designated bicycle lanes may be exclusive for bicycle use (left) or shared with motor\n    vehicle trafﬁc (right).\n\n    Pavement marking may vary between communities.\n\n    Shared bicycle lanes\n    A chevron and bicycle symbol designate a shared bicycle or “sharrow” lane.\n\n    Sharrows use pavement markings painted on a roadways to encourage cyclists and\n    motorists to share the lane. They are generally intended for use on roadways with\n    lanes that are wide enough for side-by-side bicycle and vehicle operation. However,\n    motorists should always pass cyclists at a safe distance and should not assume that\n    the sharrow indicates that they can pass within the travel lane. Depending on the\n    positioning of the cyclist, it may be necessary to change lanes in order to pass safely.\n\n    Sharrows do not designate a bicycle lane and should not be treated as such. While\n    some cyclists will ride down the centre of the arrow, in many locations, the sharrow\n    marking simply indicates cyclists and motorists are to share the lane and isn’t an\n    indication of where a cyclist rides within the lane.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.15 Turning\n3.15 Turning\nRight turns\nWhen approaching an intersection or driveway that requires a right-hand turn, move\nas close to the right curb or right edge of the road as possible.\n\nGeneral procedure:\n1. Plan your right turn well in advance. Signal, check your rear gate and check your\n   blind spot. When safe, move as close to the right as possible.\n2. Check for trafﬁc, pedestrians and other real or potential hazards in or near the\n   intersection. A basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping pattern will be\n   sufﬁcient.\n3. Slow down (shift to a lower gear if driving a manual transmission vehicle). Maintain\n   a suitable speed throughout the turn to allow for proper vehicle control and avoid\n   obstructing trafﬁc.\n4. Check again for real or potential hazards.\n5. If there are no real or potential hazards, complete your right turn into the ﬁrst\n   available driving lane.\n\nSee page 79 for rules regarding turning right on a red light.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.15 Turning\n\n\n\n    When a vehicle is parked in the lane closest to the right curb and near the\n    intersection, the driver must move into that lane at the ﬁrst opportunity before turning,\n    keeping as close to the right curb or edge of the road as possible.\n\n    Drivers may not make turns from the main driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n         Incorrect                                   Correct\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.15 Turning\nLeft turns\nLeft turns are more dangerous than right turns because you have to cross trafﬁc\ncoming from at least two directions. This means that your searching pattern is very\nimportant and you should continue to search as you cross the intersection. When\nyou intend to turn left across the path of any vehicle approaching from the opposite\ndirection, you must yield the right of way to the oncoming vehicle. When making a left\nturn, you must approach the intersection and complete the turn in the left-most lane\navailable for your direction of travel.\n\nGeneral procedure:\n1. If a lane change is required, decide well in advance to make your left turn. Signal\n   and check your rear gate and blind spot to see if there is a vehicle close to you.\n   Move safely into the left side of the left lane.\n2. Check for trafﬁc, pedestrians and any other real or potential hazards that may be\n   in or near the intersection. Use the basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping\n   pattern.\n3. Slow down (and shift to a lower gear if you are driving a manual transmission\n   vehicle).\n4. Check again for real or potential hazards. Watch out for motorcycles when\n   completing a left turn. Motorists failing to identify oncoming motorcycles when\n   making a left turn is a signiﬁcant contributing factor in collisions involving\n   motorcycles.\n5. If you have to stop in the intersection to wait for oncoming trafﬁc, be sure to keep\n   your vehicle parallel to the lane and your front wheels straight. That way if you’re hit\n   from behind, you will not be pushed in the path of oncoming trafﬁc.\n6. If there are no potential hazards, complete your left turn into the ﬁrst available\n   driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.15 Turning\n\n\n\n    A left turn from a one-way street to a two-way street should be made as close as\n    possible to the left edge of the roadway. If there are no cars parked in the curb lane,\n    you can move into that lane in advance of the corner. If there is a car in the curb lane,\n    be sure the driver is turning and not pulling over to park before entering the lane.\n\n    When you make your turn onto the two-way street, enter into the lane immediately to\n    the right of the centre line.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.15 Turning\nFor a left turn from a one-way street to a one-way street, start the turn from the left\nedge of the roadway and complete the turn in the left-most driving lane.\n\nWhen a vehicle is parked in a lane closest to the left curb and near the intersection,\nthe driver must move into that lane at the ﬁrst opportunity before turning.\n\n\n\n\nFor a left turn from a two-way street to a one-way street, turn from the lane next to the\ncentre line and enter the one-way street into the left-most driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.16 Centre turning lanes\n\n\n\n    3.16 Centre turning lanes\n    This sign indicates a two-way left turning lane. These are\n    used in many communities, especially larger centres,\n    to improve trafﬁc ﬂow and to allow for easier access to\n    properties in mid-block.\n\n    The diagram indicates the correct turning procedure. Here are\n    some other points to keep in mind when using centre turning\n    lanes:\n    • Enter the two-way left turning\n      lane only at the point adjacent\n      to the property you want to\n      access (see arrow for car A).\n    • Left turns from either direction\n      may be made from the two-way\n      left turning lane.\n    • When leaving a driveway or\n      parking lot, pick a gap in trafﬁc,\n      complete the turn by driving\n      through the centre turning\n                                            B\n      lane and into the ﬁrst available\n      driving lane as quickly as\n      possible (see arrow for car B).\n    • The centre turning lanes may\n      not be used as a passing lane\n      or as a driving lane.\n    • Where a centre turning lane is\n      provided, you may not make a\n      left turn from any other lane.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    A\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.17 Right of way\n3.17 Right of way\nUncontrolled intersections\nAt an intersection where there are no stop signs, yield signs, trafﬁc lights or police\ndirecting trafﬁc, and two vehicles arrive at the intersection at approximately the same\ntime, the driver of the vehicle on the left must yield the right of way to the driver of the\nvehicle on the right.\n\n\n\n\nThis rule also applies to T-intersections.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.17 Right of way\n\n\n\n    When turning left, you must yield the right of way to any vehicles coming toward you if\n    they are close enough that your turn would interfere with them.\n\n\n\n\n    When entering a provincial highway from any other road, you must yield the right of\n    way to any vehicles travelling on the provincial highway and to any pedestrian closely\n    approaching the intersection.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.17 Right of way\nWhen entering a street, road or highway from a private road, lane or alley, you must\nyield the right of way to any pedestrians on the sidewalk and to any vehicles on the\nstreet, road or highway.\n\n\n\n\nControlled intersections\nAt any intersection where a yield sign is present, drivers facing the sign must yield the\nright of way to any other motorist approaching the intersection.\n\nAt three and four-way stops, courtesy dictates that the ﬁrst vehicle that stops should\nbe given the right of way. The remaining three then yield the right of way to the driver\non their right.\n\nAt two-way stops, vehicles must remain stopped until all cross trafﬁc passes. When\ntwo vehicles arrive around the same time to the opposite stop signs and one of the\nvehicles is turning left, the driver turning left must yield the right of way to the driver\ngoing straight. If it’s safe, the vehicle turning left can go next, even if another vehicle\narrives in the meantime, and plans to go straight. The left turning vehicle can turn\nleft while the next vehicle advances to the stop line. This keeps trafﬁc ﬂowing. When\nopposing vehicles are both going straight, the drivers can proceed at the same time.\n\nIn any case, if you’re at a stop sign you must yield to vehicles and pedestrians and\nmay not proceed until it’s safe.\n\nAll drivers have a moral and legal responsibility to avoid collisions. If you have the right\nof way at an intersection and a driver refuses to yield to you, you’re responsible from\na safety standpoint to avoid a collision, rather than insist upon your right of way. Don’t\nforget the old adage – “You could be right – dead right.”\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.17 Right of way\n\n\n\n    Construction or maintenance vehicles\n    At all times, you must yield the right of way to any highway construction or\n    maintenance vehicles that have their warning lights ﬂashing.\n\n    Zipper merge\n    When a lane is closed in a construction zone, you might need to make a zipper\n    merge. A zipper merge means drivers use both lanes of trafﬁc until the lane ends,\n    and then alternate in “zipper” fashion into the open lane. Vehicles in the lane that’s\n    ending must signal, shoulder check and merge when safe, while each driver in the\n    continuing lane should let one vehicle in. Sometimes both lanes are merging into\n    a new lane and drivers in both lanes must signal, shoulder check and take turns\n    merging when it’s safe.\n\n    Zipper merging is beneﬁcial because it makes trafﬁc ﬂow more quickly and efﬁciently\n    for drivers in both lanes. It also creates a sense of fairness and equity since all lanes\n    are moving at the same rate. Zipper merging also helps reduce:\n    • differences in speeds between two lanes\n    • the overall length of trafﬁc backup\n    • congestion on freeway interchanges\n\n\n\n\n    Always pay attention and follow any posted signs you see in a construction area.\n    Zipper merge signs may not always be present, but zipper merging is allowed and\n    recommended in construction zones.\n\n    Remember to be courteous, merge when safe and you’ll zip through quickly.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.18 Stopping positions\n3.18 Stopping positions\nThere are several different situations you may see when preparing to stop at an\nintersection with a stop sign or trafﬁc light. Where you should stop and your stopping\nposition, is determined by markings on the road. You must stop:\n\n\n\n\nAt the nearest crosswalk,      At a clearly marked        Where there is no stop line,\nwhether marked or not.         stop line.                 sidewalk or crosswalk:\n                                                          • Within three metres of the\n                                                             intersection in a town, city,\n                                                             village or hamlet.\n                                                          • Within 10 metres of the\n                                                            intersection in a rural area.\n\n\n\n\nBehind the clearly marked X.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.19 Interchanges\n\n\n\n    3.19 Interchanges\n    Roundabouts\n    In a roundabout, the vehicle on the right must yield to the vehicle on the left.\n\n    In the diagram, trafﬁc indicated by red arrows in yellow lanes must yield to trafﬁc\n    indicated by white arrows in green lanes. Trafﬁc entering the roundabout must yield to\n    trafﬁc in the roundabout.\n\n    In this diagram:\n    • B and C must yield to A.\n    • E must yield to D while F and D proceed.\n    • H must yield to G.\n\n\n\n\n    When you’re leaving the roundabout use your right-turn signal to warn other drivers of\n    your intention to exit.\n\n    It’s recommended that for safety, entry into the right lane be used mainly when\n    intending to exit at the ﬁrst available exit point. If you are intending to proceed beyond\n    the second exit, you should drive in the left lane.\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.19 Interchanges\nDiverging Diamond Interchange\nA diverging diamond interchange is new to Saskatchewan, but is gaining popularity\nacross North America. This type of interchange is designed to improve safety and\nreduce delays by maintaining the ﬂow of trafﬁc. The key feature of this type of\ninterchange is that trafﬁc on the overpass crosses over to the opposite side of the\nroad at one trafﬁc-signal controlled ramp and then returns to the proper side at the\nnext trafﬁc-signal controlled ramp. The crossover allows higher volume left-turn trafﬁc\nto proceed with little disruption or interruption.\n\nWhen you encounter this type of intersection:\n• Watch for lane designation signs as well as pavement markings to guide you into the\n  correct lane (see “Lane selection,”page 35).\n• Trafﬁc going straight – watch for lane designation signs and ensure you’re in the\n  correct lane to proceed straight. After the trafﬁc lights, don’t panic; you will be\n  crossing onto the opposite side of the road for a short distance before crossing\n  back onto the proper side at the next trafﬁc lights.\n• Trafﬁc turning left – watch for lane designation signs and ensure you’re in the\n  correct lane to turn left. After the trafﬁc lights, don’t panic; you will be crossing onto\n  the opposite side of the road for a short distance before making your left turn.\n• Trafﬁc turning right – normal right-hand turn procedures apply, so watch for lane\n  designation signs and ensure you’re in the correct lane to turn right.\n\n\n\n\nTrafﬁc going straight\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.19 Interchanges\n\n\n\n\n    Trafﬁc turning left\n\n\n\n\n    Trafﬁc turning right\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.19 Interchanges\nRestricted Crossing U-Turn\nThe Restricted Crossing U-Turn (RCUT)\nintersection (also known as a reduced\nconﬂict intersection) is designed to\ndecrease collisions caused by motorists\nattempting to cross a four-lane divided\nhighway.\n\nAt an RCUT intersection, drivers always\nmake a right turn, followed by a U-turn.\nMotorists approaching a divided highway\nwith an RCUT intersection are not allowed\nto make a left turn or drive straight through\nto cross the divided highway. Instead,\ndrivers must do the following:\n\n1. Using the entrance ramp, make a right\n   turn into the acceleration lane to enter\n   the highway.\n2. When it is safe to do so, signal, check\n   your mirrors, shoulder check and\n   change lanes into the far-left lane to\n   enter the U-turn lane.\n\n\n\n\n3. Complete the U-turn into the\n   acceleration lane going the opposite\n   direction.\n4. When it is safe to do so, signal, check\n   your mirrors, shoulder check and\n   change lanes into the far right driving\n   lane to continue straight or into the far\n   right turning lane to complete a right\n   turn.\n5. Remember to shoulder check when\n   changing multiple lanes.\n\n\n\n\n             This is a general representation\n              of the intersection.

If a trafﬁc light changes while a\n    pedestrian is in the crosswalk, the pedestrian has the right of way.\n\n    You must stop your vehicle when directed to do so by a school crossing guard\n    controlling a crosswalk.\n\n    You may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an intersection to permit pedestrians\n    to cross.\n\n    As a pedestrian, you must not attempt to cross at an intersection unless you have\n    given motorists a chance to stop.\n\n    Pedestrians walking along a road should walk on the left shoulder, facing oncoming\n    trafﬁc.\n\n    Note: Pedestrians also include persons in wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs and\n    medical scooters.\n\n    Jaywalkers\n    Jaywalking is when a pedestrian crosses a roadway in violation of trafﬁc laws, typically\n    when crossing outside of a marked or unmarked intersection.\n    You must always be prepared to stop if you see a pedestrian who is about to step out\n    in front of you. But don’t encourage jaywalking by stopping and inviting pedestrians to\n    cross. The car behind you may not be expecting you to stop and may collide with you.\n    Also, drivers in the other lanes might not see the pedestrian crossing in front of your\n    vehicle and may hit them.\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.22 Crossing urban streets • 3.23 Wheelchairs and medical scooters\n3.22 Crossing urban streets\nYou may drive across a street only at an intersection, lane or alley.\n\nNote: In some cities, crossing a street at a lane or alley is prohibited by a local bylaw.\n\n\n3.23 Wheelchairs and medical scooters\nThe rules of the road that apply to pedestrians also\napply to persons using a wheelchair, motorized\nwheelchair or medical scooter for medical reasons.\n\nWhen approaching an intersection, you must yield the\nright of way to any person crossing the street who is\nusing a wheelchair, motorized wheelchair or medical\nscooter. This does not apply to wide streets if the\nperson in the wheelchair is at a safe distance from\nyour side of the street.\n\nYou must stop your vehicle before the crosswalk,\nwhich will either be painted on the road or be an\nimaginary extension of the sidewalk.\n\nYou may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an\nintersection to permit persons using wheelchairs,\nmotorized wheelchairs or medical scooters to cross.\n\nPersons in wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs or medical scooters must not attempt\nto cross at an intersection unless they have given motorists a chance to stop.\n\nThe sidewalk should always be the ﬁrst choice while using a wheelchair, motorized\nwheelchair or medical scooter. When there is no wheelchair accessible curb, get onto\nthe sidewalk using the ﬁrst available driveway.\n\nLike pedestrians, persons using wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs or medical\nscooters travelling along a road where no sidewalk exists should travel on the left\nshoulder, facing oncoming trafﬁc. Wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs or medical\nscooters should also have a brightly coloured ﬂag attached to increase visibility to\nmotorists.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road",

        "content": "\nThe driver of a large truck or bus has difﬁculty turning sharp corners, particularly to\nthe right. If the driver follows the proper procedure, vehicles facing them on the street\nthey are entering should be prepared for the large truck or bus to enter their half of\nthe roadway. If the large truck operator is not following the proper procedure, vehicles\non their right in the street they are leaving should stay well back to avoid being\ncrushed between the large truck and the curb. When you see a large truck or bus\nmaking a sharp right turn, give it the room it needs.\n\nAll drivers should avoid a large truck’s “no-zone.” The no-zone refers to the blindspot\nareas around big trucks, where crashes are most likely to occur. Just like cars, large\ntrucks have blindspots on both sides, but a large truck’s are considerably bigger.\nThese blindspots can mean trouble if a trucker decides to change lanes and a car is in\nthe blindspot. In addition to the blindspots on the sides of a large truck, drivers should\nbe careful around the front end of large trucks.\n\nTruckers sit up high and the hood of the cab obscures part of the road ahead. This is\nwhy when drivers in a car are passing a large truck, they should make sure they can\nsee the entire truck cab in their rear-view mirror before pulling in front. If a car cuts\nin too soon, truck drivers are forced to react with little time or room to spare. Large\ntrucks also have deep rear blindspots. A good rule of thumb is that if you can’t see the\nlarge truck’s mirrors, the truck driver can’t see you.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.4 Sharing the road\n\n\n\n\n    Sharing the road with snow plows\n    • Slow down – STAY BACK and STAY ALIVE when you\n      approach the mini blizzard created by a snow plow.\n    • Every winter, snow plows are hit by motorists who don’t\n      see them or see them too late. The vast majority of these\n      incidents are rear-end collisions where motorists have\n      failed to adjust to changing road and weather conditions.\n    • Snow plow operators are working in difﬁcult weather conditions on the highways to\n      clear snow and ice and make the roads safer for all motorists.\n    • Drivers must slow to 60 km/h when passing snow plows or other highway\n      equipment that are stopped on the highway with blue and amber warning lights\n      ﬂashing.\n    • Snow plows that are in motion, can be passed on the highway if it’s safe to do so.\n      Drivers in this case are not limited to travelling 60 km/h.\n    • Snow plows must travel slower than average trafﬁc when clearing snow and\n      spreading salt and sand. Be patient and proceed with caution.\n    • Ministry of Highways crews clear major highways within six hours of the end of the\n      storm to make winter driving safe. Please give them room to work safely.\n\n    Sharing the road with snowmobiles, ATVs\n    and golf carts\n    If snowmobiles and ATVs were always operated\n    according to the law, there would be little chance of\n    conﬂict with other vehicles on the streets and highways.\n    Unfortunately, this isn’t always the case.\n\n    Snowmobiles are difﬁcult to see because they are small\n    and low. These features, accompanied by exposure\n    to weather, also make it difﬁcult for the snowmobile\n    operator to see. As snowmobiles are useful in storms,\n    they’re likely to be out when visibility is poor.\n\n    Also, children with little road experience operate snowmobiles and ATVs. When you\n    see a snowmobile or ATV, anticipate that it may cross the road suddenly or go out of\n    control, and decide how you will react.\n\n    In some municipalities, local bylaws allow snowmobiles, ATVs and golf carts to be\n    operated on the street.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.4 Sharing the road\nSharing the road with emergency vehicles\nAll emergency vehicles (ﬁre engines, police vehicles\nambulances, and emergency vehicles that have been\ndesignated by a municipality or the Highway Trafﬁc\nBoard to be used in response to an emergency) have\nthe right of way when displaying ﬂashing lights and\nusing sirens (sound devices).\n• When approached by an emergency vehicle with\n  its lights ﬂashing or sirens engaged, you must\n  immediately drive as closely as possible to the\n  right edge of the roadway and not enter the next\n  intersection until the emergency vehicle has passed.\n  The only exception is if a peace ofﬁcer gives you\n  other directions. On one-way streets, pull right or left\n  to the nearest curb.\n• At an intersection, you must stop and let the emergency vehicle through the\n  intersection, unless given other directions by a peace ofﬁcer.\n\nIf the emergency vehicle has its lights ﬂashing, but no siren engaged, motorists in the\nvicinity should extend the same privilege as previously mentioned while meeting or\nbeing overtaken by the emergency vehicle.\n\n• When an emergency vehicle is stopped on the highway with its emergency lights in\n  operation, you must slow down to 60 km/h when passing it. This doesn’t apply to\n  vehicles travelling in the opposite direction on a divided highway. However, this does\n  apply when travelling in the opposite direction on an undivided highway.\n• Never attempt to follow an emergency vehicle going to, or coming from, an emergency.\n\nSharing the road with farm equipment and\noverwidth vehicles\nSaskatchewan’s agricultural base means that\nfarm equipment such as combines, tractors, large\ncultivators, etc. may be on highways and grid roads\nfrom early spring until late fall.\n\nThese vehicles create a hazard, as they travel very\nslowly – 10 to 40 km/h. Therefore, you may come\nupon them very quickly and you’ll need to stop or\nchange lanes rapidly. Watch for them on the road and\nonly pass them when it’s safe to do so.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.4 Sharing the road\n\n\n\n    Sharing the road with school buses\n    School bus drivers have a difﬁcult job. There are\n    plenty of distractions inside the bus. Knowing this,\n    you should make extra allowances, and be aware of\n    the possibility that the bus driver may not see you or\n    your signals. Rear-end collisions are the most frequent\n    type of crash involving school buses and are usually\n    caused by another driver failing to stop while the bus\n    is loading or unloading passengers.\n\n    When approaching a school bus, if you see amber ﬂashing lights, slow down and\n    proceed with caution. If the red ﬂashing lights are activated, you must come to a\n    complete stop. If you’re approaching the bus from the opposite direction on an\n    undivided highway, you must also stop. The single greatest threat to the safety of\n    children who ride school buses is motorists who pass the bus when children are\n    loading or unloading.\n\n    When approaching a bus that has its stop arm out and its red ﬂashing lights activated,\n    as a driver:\n    • You must stop no closer than 5 m (15 ft.) from the front or back of the bus.\n    • You must not advance your vehicle until the bus driver turns off the ﬂashing red stop\n      lamps and deactivates the stop arm.\n    • Before moving, check to see that all children have safely crossed the roadway.\n\n    Passing a school bus with red ﬂashing lights is a serious offence and will result in\n    a minimum ﬁne of $360. You don’t have to stop for a school bus if you’re travelling\n    in the opposite direction on a divided highway. Some cities, towns and villages may\n    have a bylaw prohibiting the use of ﬂashing red stop lamps and stop arms on school\n    buses. In those communities you’re allowed to pass the bus. Drivers aren’t required to\n    stop for buses displaying four-way hazard lamps; however, use caution, go slowly and\n    always watch for children crossing.\n\n    Sharing the road with motorcycles\n    When a motorcycle and a four-wheel vehicle collide,\n    the motorcyclist is at a high risk for being killed or\n    severely injured. Since motorcycles are more agile\n    than cars, their actions are more difﬁcult to predict and\n    their size makes them hard to see.\n\n    Most motorcycles are wired so that their headlights\n    are on at all times, making it easier for you to see\n    them. Be alert for motorcycles that don’t have their\n    headlights on. During motorcycle season, check twice\n    before making a lane change or turn – once for cars\n    and trucks, and once for motorcycles and bikes.\n\n    When passing a motorcycle, ensure you leave adequate distance ahead of the\n    motorcycle before you pull back in to the lane. Failure to leave sufﬁcient room can be\n    extremely dangerous for the motorcyclist.\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.4 Sharing the road\nThe same three-second following distance should be given to motorcycles as is given\nto other vehicles. Following too closely may cause a motorcycle rider’s attention to be\ndistracted from the road and trafﬁc ahead.\n\nMotorcyclists are allowed to ride two abreast but most riders prefer to have a full\nlane width. A skilled motorcyclist is constantly changing positions within a lane to\nincrease his ability to see and be seen, and to avoid objects on the road. Never move\ninto the same lane beside a motorcycle, even if the lane is wide and the motorcyclist\nis riding to one side. It is not only illegal, it’s extremely hazardous. When overtaking a\nmotorcycle or bicycle in your lane, you must pass in the same manner as you would\npass a car.\n\nBad weather and slippery surfaces cause greater problems for motorcycles than for\ncars. Allow more following distance for motorcycles when the road surface is wet and\nslippery. These conditions create stability problems.\n\nBeing aware of these situations can help you share the road safely with all cyclists.\n\nNew motorcyclists are required to display a\nMotorcycle Graduated Driver Licensing (MGDL)\nplacard on their licence plate identifying them\nas new riders. Learners are required to display\na red ‘L’ placard and Novice riders must display\ngreen ‘N’ placards. Please use caution when\npassing or following a new rider and give them\nplenty of space.\n\n\nSharing the road with bicycles\nBicycles are vehicles too and entitled to their\nshare of the road. More people are using them for\ntransportation, recreation, physical ﬁtness, and to\nreduce emissions. Cyclists must obey the same rules\nof the road as other vehicles.\n\nCyclists travelling at a lower speed than other trafﬁc\nare expected to ride about one metre from the curb or\nparked cars, or as close as practical to the right-hand\nedge of the road when there is no curb.\n• Cyclists are not required to ride close to the right edge of the road when they are\n  travelling at or faster than the normal speed of trafﬁc at that time and place, or when\n  they are turning left, or getting in position to turn left.\nBike lanes are reserved for cyclists. Sometimes you will need to enter or cross a bike\nlane to turn right at a corner or driveway. Take extra care when you do this. Enter the\nbike lane only after ensuring that you can do so safely, and then make the turn.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.4 Sharing the road\n\n\n\n    When you’re sharing the road with cyclists please remember:\n    • Many children riding bicycles on the street are very young and lack the necessary\n      training and skills for safe cycling.\n    • When passing or overtaking a cyclist, go around them like you would any other\n      vehicle.\n    • Watch for cyclists’ hand signals. A cyclist may indicate a right-hand turn by extending\n      their right arm. If possible, try to make eye contact with cyclists.\n    • When turning left, you must stop and wait for oncoming bicycles to pass before\n      turning.\n    • When driving through an intersection, be careful to scan for cyclists waiting to turn\n      left.\n    • When you’re preparing to make a right turn, watch for cyclists who may pull up\n      alongside your vehicle. Check your blind spots.\n    • When making a right turn, do not pull up beside a cyclist and then turn directly in front\n      of them and cut them off.\n    • When pulling away from the curb always check for cyclists who may be travelling near\n      the right edge of the lane or curb.\n    • When parked at the curb, always check for cyclists when you open your vehicle door.\n    • Give cyclists space with a safe following distance. They do not have brake lights to\n      warn you when they’re slowing or stopping.\n    • Cyclists are entitled to make left turns the same way as motorists. Since they\n      are exposed on left turns, they will need extra consideration, especially on\n      multi-lane roads.\n    • It’s easy to misjudge the speed of bicycles — they can travel faster than you think!\n      Experienced cyclists can travel at 25-35 km/h on a ﬂat surface and up to 50km/h\n      going downhill.\n    • Cyclists are entitled to ride at least one metre from the curb and may ride even further\n      out when they steer away from drainage grates, potholes, debris, loose gravel or sand,\n      wet or slippery surfaces, rutted or grooved pavement and even dogs. Be aware of the\n      roadway conditions that may affect a cyclist.\n    • Don’t use your horn when you’re passing a cyclist. It may frighten them and cause\n      them to steer into your path. If you feel that you must use your horn, tap it quickly and\n      lightly while you are still some distance away from the cyclist.\n    There’s also a class of bicycle called power-assisted bicycles, commonly known as\n    e-bikes or electric bicycles and many are designed to look like scooters equipped\n    with pedals. These types of vehicles use an electric motor to help the operator up to a\n    maximum speed of 32 km/h. Treat them the same way you would any other cyclist.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.4 Sharing the road\nSharing the road with e-scooters\n(electric kick scooters)\nE-scooters (also known as electric kick scooters or\nelectric scooters) are known as limited speed motor\nvehicles and are permitted in communities, towns, or\ncities that have speciﬁc e-scooter bylaws in place. To\nsee if they’re legal in your community, please reach out\nto your municipality directly.\nE-scooters don’t need to be registered and don’t require a driver’s licence, but users\nmust be at least 16 years old, wear an approved helmet, follow all municipal laws and\nprovincial regulations and legislation.\n\nIf e-scooters are allowed on public roads in a community, motor vehicle drivers and\nother road users must learn to share the road with e-scooters. It’s important to know\nthe rules within each community that you drive in. For more information on e-scooters,\nplease visit www.sgi.sk.ca/e-scooters or call our Customer Service Centre at\n1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744).\n\nSharing the road with tow trucksand vehicles rendering assistance on the roadside\nWhen a vehicle used exclusively for towing or\nrendering assistance is stopped on a roadside with\nits amber or amber and blue lights ﬂashing to help a\ndisabled vehicle, drivers must slow to 60 km/h when\npassing. This does not apply to vehicles travelling in\nthe opposite direction on a divided highway. However,\nthis does apply when travelling in the opposite\ndirection on an undivided highway.\n\nSharing the road with funeral processions\nFuneral processions have special privileges and\nshould not be interfered with or interrupted. They\nmust, however, obey all trafﬁc signs and signals –\nunless all drivers with the right of way stop to permit\nthe procession to proceed.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.5 The concept of gates\n\n\n\n    3.5 The concept of gates\n    The concept of “gates” is introduced to\n    help you understand how to deal with\n    vehicles around you.\n\n    Imagine four gates surround your\n    vehicle at all times. One gate is located\n    in front of the vehicle, one is behind and\n    one is on each side of the vehicle.\n\n    When you’re travelling alone in the centre lane of a road where there are three lanes\n    provided in the direction you’re travelling, all four gates are open to you. This means\n    you can move ahead, slow down and drop back, or move to your right or left, and still\n    continue uninterrupted movement.\n\n\n\n\n    If a gate is open you can drive into it whenever you want to. A safe driver always tries\n    to have at least two open gates to provide options for emergency movement.\n\n\n\n\n    If a gate is closed – by another vehicle, a curb, a guardrail or even deep snow – you\n    lose the opportunity to move into the area that gate controls.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.5 The concept of gates • 3.6 Blind spots\nCheck your mirrors to ensure you know which gates are open. You need to check\nyour inside mirror and your left outside mirror often. When you’re a more experienced\ndriver, start using your right mirror, if you have one.\n\nWhile you aren’t required to identify a vehicle in detail, you should know whether the\nrear gate is open so that you could drop back if you wished.\n\nIf the vehicle behind you is tailgating, then your rear gate is closed. You need to\nleave extra following distance ahead to allow room if you have to stop. Increase your\nfollowing distance to ﬁve or six seconds (see “Using time to estimate your following\ndistance,” page 87).\n\nHow often you check your mirrors depends upon the number of lanes and the amount\nof trafﬁc. If you’ve ever been surprised by a vehicle overtaking you, then you’re not\nlooking in your mirrors often enough.\n\n\n3.6 Blind spots\nA “blind spot” is an area alongside your vehicle that\nyou can’t see when using any of your mirrors. It’s                BLIND SPOT\nimportant to check these blind spots to ensure your\nside gates are open, particularly if you’re going to\nchange lanes.\n\nA quick glance over your shoulder, or “shoulder\ncheck,” can allow you to see the entire side gate area            BLIND SPOT\nof your vehicle, which could be a blind spot.\nShoulder check your blind spot for the gate you’re driving into. For the left side, turn\nyour head left until you are looking along your shoulder. You’re checking to see if there\nis a vehicle closing your gate. If there is something there, don’t try to move into that\nspace. To check the right side, you need to turn your head to the right.\n\nWatch out for motorcyclists and bicyclists, especially during low light conditions (dusk\nand dawn) or during periods of inclement weather, as these vehicles are small, fast\nand very manoeuvrable and may be easy to miss during a shoulder check.\n\n\n\n\nFor your own safety and the safety of other motorists, don’t drive in other drivers’ blind\nspots. Move forward, or drop back, as soon as you notice this situation.\n\nThe blind spot can be signiﬁcantly reduced if your mirrors are properly adjusted (see\npage 103).\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.7 Directional dividing lines\n\n\n\n    3.7 Directional dividing lines\n    Yellow directional dividing lines separate\n    trafﬁc travelling in opposite directions.\n\n    White line markings are used to separate\n    trafﬁc travelling in the same direction.\n\n    Freeway lanes, as well as some city street\n    lanes, which are ending will usually be\n    marked by double wide lines painted on\n    the pavement. If you’re driving in a lane\n    marked with double wide lines, be\n    prepared for the lane to end. You’ll have to\n    exit the freeway, turn at the next intersection,\n    or merge. Look for signs.\n\n\n\n\n    Vehicle A may pass if the road is clear ahead and behind.\n\n\n\n\n    Vehicle A must not pass or make a left turn between intersections.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.8 Trafﬁc Lanes • 3.9 Lane position • 3.10 Lane selection\n3.8 Trafﬁc lanes\nOn roads with marked lanes, you must travel entirely in one lane. Where there are no\nlane lines marked, you should travel as if there were markings there. Changing lanes is\npermitted only when safe to do so.\n\nWhere a solid line separates lanes, you may not move across the solid line. The only\nexceptions are double lines in the centre of a highway where the line nearest you is a\nbroken line (see the preceding illustrations) or centre turning lanes .\n\n\n3.9 Lane position\nOn highways or rural roads, keep to the right of your lane.\n\nIn urban areas, you’ll usually drive in the middle of the lane. However, your position in\nthe lane should allow you to see as much as possible.\n\nYour lane position provides information to other drivers. If you intend to turn left, move\nto the left side of the lane. If you’re going to turn right, move to the right side of the\nlane, but be careful to leave enough room for passing parked vehicles.\n\nAt some intersections, signs or trafﬁc lights indicate two or more lanes may be used\nto complete a turn. At these locations, you must approach the intersection and\ncomplete the turn in the same relative lane position.\n\n\n\n\n3.10 Lane selection\nChoose the driving lane that gives you the best vision and allows you to keep the\nmaximum number of gates open.\n\n• On slippery surfaces, pick the part of the lane that offers the most traction.\n• When turning at intersections, choose the lane that the law says you must take (see\n  “Turning,” page 41). On a divided highway use the left lane to approach a left turn\n  off the highway.\n• On a multi-lane divided highway the left lane is intended for vehicles to pass slower\n  moving right lane vehicles or for emergency vehicles. The maximum speed posted\n  is the maximum under ideal road conditions. See page 117 for safe merging on a\n  freeway.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.10 Lane selection • 3.11 Signalling\n\n\n\n    It’s not a good practice to drive on the shoulder portion of the road. The area of the\n    roadway to the right of the solid white line is designed for stopped vehicles. As well,\n    the shoulder can be used for emergency manoeuvres, or preparing to make a right\n    turn from a highway. The shoulder is not an extra driving lane. Some highways have\n    rumble strips on the shoulder, and in some cases on the centre line, to alert drivers\n    when they drift out of their lane.\n\n\n    3.11 Signalling\n    You must turn on your signal lights in advance of your turn or lane change. A good\n    rule when driving at speeds under 60 km/h is to signal at least 30 m before turning.\n    At higher speeds, signal at least 150 m from the corner.\n\n    When changing lanes, you must signal and do mirror and shoulder checks before you\n    begin to move out of your lane.\n\n    If your signal lights or brake lights fail, these hand signals must be used.\n\n\n\n\n    Left turn                       Right turn                   Stopping or slowing abruptly\n\n    Turn signals\n    When you use turn signals, you’re saying, “I intend to turn or change lanes.” If you\n    wait until you’re actually turning or changing lanes before you signal, you’re not telling\n    other drivers what you intend to do. They can already see that you’re turning.\n\n    The procedure when you plan to turn or change lanes:\n    1. Assuming that you know the status of your gates and are properly positioned for\n       the turn, signal.\n    2. Check your mirror.\n    3. Shoulder check your blind spot for the gate you are moving into.\n    4. Start the turn or lane change.\n    5. Cancel signal once turn or lane change is complete.\n\n    If you are approaching an intersection and want to change lanes, complete your lane\n    change and cancel your signal before entering the intersection or wait until you pass\n    through the intersection before turning on your signal and changing lanes. This helps\n    to keep intersections safer and avoid confusion.\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.12 Changing lanes • 3.13 Passing\n3.12 Changing lanes\nThe procedure for changing lanes:\n1. Determine the need to change lanes well in advance. Make sure you know the\n   conditions of your gate.\n2. Signal your intention to change lanes.\n3. Check your mirrors to see that the gate is open and that no one else is moving into it.\n4. Shoulder check to look for vehicles or obstructions in your blind spot.\n5. Look where you want the vehicle to go and steer there.\n6. Accelerate gently and steer the vehicle to the position where you’re looking.\n7. When you’re almost completely in the new lane, look ahead to the point where you\n   intend to drive and your steering will adjust.\n8. Cancel signal. Check the condition of your new gates. Adjust your speed.\n\n\n\n\nWhen moving through more than a single lane, make the change as one continual\naction. Only one signal is required, and don’t forget to shoulder check.\n\n\n3.13 Passing\nWhen meeting other vehicles, you must keep to the right of the centre line of the\nroadway.\n\nHead-on collisions are usually fatal. Driver distraction (e.g., texting/talking on a\ncellphone, eating, etc.), driver impairment (fatigue, alcohol, drugs) or driver errors,\nsuch as faulty judgment or techniques while passing, are often contributing factors in\nthese collisions..\n\nWhen passing, it’s very important to keep the time spent on the wrong side of the\nroad to a bare minimum.\n\nWhen passing:\n1. Make sure the pass is legal, safe and necessary. Don’t cross solid or double solid\n   yellow lines. Don’t pass on the crest of a hill, before a curve, at intersections or any\n   place where your sight distance is limited.\n2. Maintain a minimum three-second following distance between you and the vehicle\n   you are following (see “Using time to estimate your following distance,”\n   page 87). When you decide to pass, accelerate to build up speed before\n   passing. The greater the difference in speed between you and the vehicle you’re\n   passing, the shorter your passing time will be.\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.13 Passing\n\n\n\n    3. Continue to accelerate throughout the entire pass. Don’t slow down until you’re\n       back in your original lane and well in front of the vehicle you just passed. Keep in\n       mind that it’s illegal to speed even when passing.\n    4. Wait until you see the vehicle being passed in your inside rear-view mirror before\n       pulling back into your travelling lane. Remember, you must signal, check your\n       mirrors and shoulder check to ensure it’s safe to re-enter your travelling lane.\n\n    Note: At high speeds, the lane change is more gradual and takes longer to complete.\n\n    When passing other vehicles, you must always pass on the left except:\n    • where there are two or more trafﬁc lanes in your direction of travel\n    • any time the vehicle ahead is about to make a left turn and it is possible to pass\n      safely on the right without driving on the shoulder\n\n    You may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an intersection to permit pedestrians to\n    cross.\n\n    When being passed on the left by another vehicle, stay to the right of your lane and\n    maintain your speed. Don’t accelerate or obstruct the passing vehicle from returning\n    to the right lane.\n\n    Passing Lanes\n    Passing lanes are designed to allow vehicles to pass safely and improve the ﬂow of\n    trafﬁc. A passing lane is an additional lane added to a highway that permits a slower\n    vehicle to move into the right hand lane, while a faster vehicle can pass safely in the\n    left hand lane.\n\n    The right hand lane is designated for travel and the left hand lane is only to be used\n    for passing. Maintain your speed when moving into the right hand lane and do not\n    speed up.\n\n    Signs will alert you of a passing lane ahead. Have patience, maintain a safe following\n    distance and wait for the passing lane instead of using the oncoming trafﬁc lane,\n    which can be dangerous.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes\n3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes\nMajor centres often have designated bus and/or bicycle lanes\nthat other motorists must stay out of unless they need to\nenter them to turn, park or for entering a lane or driveway.\n\nBus lanes are marked by a lane sign that indicates the time\nand days of operation of the restriction. The sign has a\ndiamond on it, as well as a bus symbol. In some centres, the\nlane itself has diamond markings installed in the pavement.\nOn these designated streets, curb lanes are reserved for\ntransit vehicles during the rush hour, or peak driving times.\nWhen bus lane hours are in effect, no one is allowed to operate a vehicle, other than\na bus or an emergency vehicle, in the designated curb lane, except for the purpose\nof making a right turn onto, or off of, a street block where a bus lane is in effect.\nOnly buses, emergency vehicles or accessible taxicabs loading or unloading non-\nambulatory passengers are allowed to stop in a designated bus lane.\n\n\n\n\nThis sign indicates the\nstreet you’re turning to has a\ndesignated lane.\n\n                                                                    Bicycle lane\n\n\nBicycle-only lanes are dedicated for cyclists and are similar to bus lanes. Vehicles\naren’t allowed in bicycle-only lanes except for the purpose of making a right turn,\naccessing a parking space or entering a lane or driveway.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.14 Bus lanes and bicycle lanes\n\n\n\n      Exclusive bicycle lanes                       Shared bicycle lanes\n\n\n\n\n    Designated bicycle lanes may be exclusive for bicycle use (left) or shared with motor\n    vehicle trafﬁc (right).\n\n    Pavement marking may vary between communities.\n\n    Shared bicycle lanes\n    A chevron and bicycle symbol designate a shared bicycle or “sharrow” lane.\n\n    Sharrows use pavement markings painted on a roadways to encourage cyclists and\n    motorists to share the lane. They are generally intended for use on roadways with\n    lanes that are wide enough for side-by-side bicycle and vehicle operation. However,\n    motorists should always pass cyclists at a safe distance and should not assume that\n    the sharrow indicates that they can pass within the travel lane. Depending on the\n    positioning of the cyclist, it may be necessary to change lanes in order to pass safely.\n\n    Sharrows do not designate a bicycle lane and should not be treated as such. While\n    some cyclists will ride down the centre of the arrow, in many locations, the sharrow\n    marking simply indicates cyclists and motorists are to share the lane and isn’t an\n    indication of where a cyclist rides within the lane.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.15 Turning\n3.15 Turning\nRight turns\nWhen approaching an intersection or driveway that requires a right-hand turn, move\nas close to the right curb or right edge of the road as possible.\n\nGeneral procedure:\n1. Plan your right turn well in advance. Signal, check your rear gate and check your\n   blind spot. When safe, move as close to the right as possible.\n2. Check for trafﬁc, pedestrians and other real or potential hazards in or near the\n   intersection. A basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping pattern will be\n   sufﬁcient.\n3. Slow down (shift to a lower gear if driving a manual transmission vehicle). Maintain\n   a suitable speed throughout the turn to allow for proper vehicle control and avoid\n   obstructing trafﬁc.\n4. Check again for real or potential hazards.\n5. If there are no real or potential hazards, complete your right turn into the ﬁrst\n   available driving lane.\n\nSee page 79 for rules regarding turning right on a red light.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.15 Turning\n\n\n\n    When a vehicle is parked in the lane closest to the right curb and near the\n    intersection, the driver must move into that lane at the ﬁrst opportunity before turning,\n    keeping as close to the right curb or edge of the road as possible.\n\n    Drivers may not make turns from the main driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n         Incorrect                                   Correct\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.15 Turning\nLeft turns\nLeft turns are more dangerous than right turns because you have to cross trafﬁc\ncoming from at least two directions. This means that your searching pattern is very\nimportant and you should continue to search as you cross the intersection. When\nyou intend to turn left across the path of any vehicle approaching from the opposite\ndirection, you must yield the right of way to the oncoming vehicle. When making a left\nturn, you must approach the intersection and complete the turn in the left-most lane\navailable for your direction of travel.\n\nGeneral procedure:\n1. If a lane change is required, decide well in advance to make your left turn. Signal\n   and check your rear gate and blind spot to see if there is a vehicle close to you.\n   Move safely into the left side of the left lane.\n2. Check for trafﬁc, pedestrians and any other real or potential hazards that may be\n   in or near the intersection. Use the basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping\n   pattern.\n3. Slow down (and shift to a lower gear if you are driving a manual transmission\n   vehicle).\n4. Check again for real or potential hazards. Watch out for motorcycles when\n   completing a left turn. Motorists failing to identify oncoming motorcycles when\n   making a left turn is a signiﬁcant contributing factor in collisions involving\n   motorcycles.\n5. If you have to stop in the intersection to wait for oncoming trafﬁc, be sure to keep\n   your vehicle parallel to the lane and your front wheels straight. That way if you’re hit\n   from behind, you will not be pushed in the path of oncoming trafﬁc.\n6. If there are no potential hazards, complete your left turn into the ﬁrst available\n   driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.15 Turning\n\n\n\n    A left turn from a one-way street to a two-way street should be made as close as\n    possible to the left edge of the roadway. If there are no cars parked in the curb lane,\n    you can move into that lane in advance of the corner. If there is a car in the curb lane,\n    be sure the driver is turning and not pulling over to park before entering the lane.\n\n    When you make your turn onto the two-way street, enter into the lane immediately to\n    the right of the centre line.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.15 Turning\nFor a left turn from a one-way street to a one-way street, start the turn from the left\nedge of the roadway and complete the turn in the left-most driving lane.\n\nWhen a vehicle is parked in a lane closest to the left curb and near the intersection,\nthe driver must move into that lane at the ﬁrst opportunity before turning.\n\n\n\n\nFor a left turn from a two-way street to a one-way street, turn from the lane next to the\ncentre line and enter the one-way street into the left-most driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.16 Centre turning lanes\n\n\n\n    3.16 Centre turning lanes\n    This sign indicates a two-way left turning lane. These are\n    used in many communities, especially larger centres,\n    to improve trafﬁc ﬂow and to allow for easier access to\n    properties in mid-block.\n\n    The diagram indicates the correct turning procedure. Here are\n    some other points to keep in mind when using centre turning\n    lanes:\n    • Enter the two-way left turning\n      lane only at the point adjacent\n      to the property you want to\n      access (see arrow for car A).\n    • Left turns from either direction\n      may be made from the two-way\n      left turning lane.\n    • When leaving a driveway or\n      parking lot, pick a gap in trafﬁc,\n      complete the turn by driving\n      through the centre turning\n                                            B\n      lane and into the ﬁrst available\n      driving lane as quickly as\n      possible (see arrow for car B).\n    • The centre turning lanes may\n      not be used as a passing lane\n      or as a driving lane.\n    • Where a centre turning lane is\n      provided, you may not make a\n      left turn from any other lane.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    A\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.17 Right of way\n3.17 Right of way\nUncontrolled intersections\nAt an intersection where there are no stop signs, yield signs, trafﬁc lights or police\ndirecting trafﬁc, and two vehicles arrive at the intersection at approximately the same\ntime, the driver of the vehicle on the left must yield the right of way to the driver of the\nvehicle on the right.\n\n\n\n\nThis rule also applies to T-intersections.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.17 Right of way\n\n\n\n    When turning left, you must yield the right of way to any vehicles coming toward you if\n    they are close enough that your turn would interfere with them.\n\n\n\n\n    When entering a provincial highway from any other road, you must yield the right of\n    way to any vehicles travelling on the provincial highway and to any pedestrian closely\n    approaching the intersection.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.17 Right of way\nWhen entering a street, road or highway from a private road, lane or alley, you must\nyield the right of way to any pedestrians on the sidewalk and to any vehicles on the\nstreet, road or highway.\n\n\n\n\nControlled intersections\nAt any intersection where a yield sign is present, drivers facing the sign must yield the\nright of way to any other motorist approaching the intersection.\n\nAt three and four-way stops, courtesy dictates that the ﬁrst vehicle that stops should\nbe given the right of way. The remaining three then yield the right of way to the driver\non their right.\n\nAt two-way stops, vehicles must remain stopped until all cross trafﬁc passes. When\ntwo vehicles arrive around the same time to the opposite stop signs and one of the\nvehicles is turning left, the driver turning left must yield the right of way to the driver\ngoing straight. If it’s safe, the vehicle turning left can go next, even if another vehicle\narrives in the meantime, and plans to go straight. The left turning vehicle can turn\nleft while the next vehicle advances to the stop line. This keeps trafﬁc ﬂowing. When\nopposing vehicles are both going straight, the drivers can proceed at the same time.\n\nIn any case, if you’re at a stop sign you must yield to vehicles and pedestrians and\nmay not proceed until it’s safe.\n\nAll drivers have a moral and legal responsibility to avoid collisions. If you have the right\nof way at an intersection and a driver refuses to yield to you, you’re responsible from\na safety standpoint to avoid a collision, rather than insist upon your right of way. Don’t\nforget the old adage – “You could be right – dead right.”\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.17 Right of way\n\n\n\n    Construction or maintenance vehicles\n    At all times, you must yield the right of way to any highway construction or\n    maintenance vehicles that have their warning lights ﬂashing.\n\n    Zipper merge\n    When a lane is closed in a construction zone, you might need to make a zipper\n    merge. A zipper merge means drivers use both lanes of trafﬁc until the lane ends,\n    and then alternate in “zipper” fashion into the open lane. Vehicles in the lane that’s\n    ending must signal, shoulder check and merge when safe, while each driver in the\n    continuing lane should let one vehicle in. Sometimes both lanes are merging into\n    a new lane and drivers in both lanes must signal, shoulder check and take turns\n    merging when it’s safe.\n\n    Zipper merging is beneﬁcial because it makes trafﬁc ﬂow more quickly and efﬁciently\n    for drivers in both lanes. It also creates a sense of fairness and equity since all lanes\n    are moving at the same rate. Zipper merging also helps reduce:\n    • differences in speeds between two lanes\n    • the overall length of trafﬁc backup\n    • congestion on freeway interchanges\n\n\n\n\n    Always pay attention and follow any posted signs you see in a construction area.\n    Zipper merge signs may not always be present, but zipper merging is allowed and\n    recommended in construction zones.\n\n    Remember to be courteous, merge when safe and you’ll zip through quickly.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.18 Stopping positions\n3.18 Stopping positions\nThere are several different situations you may see when preparing to stop at an\nintersection with a stop sign or trafﬁc light. Where you should stop and your stopping\nposition, is determined by markings on the road. You must stop:\n\n\n\n\nAt the nearest crosswalk,      At a clearly marked        Where there is no stop line,\nwhether marked or not.         stop line.                 sidewalk or crosswalk:\n                                                          • Within three metres of the\n                                                             intersection in a town, city,\n                                                             village or hamlet.\n                                                          • Within 10 metres of the\n                                                            intersection in a rural area.\n\n\n\n\nBehind the clearly marked X.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.19 Interchanges\n\n\n\n    3.19 Interchanges\n    Roundabouts\n    In a roundabout, the vehicle on the right must yield to the vehicle on the left.\n\n    In the diagram, trafﬁc indicated by red arrows in yellow lanes must yield to trafﬁc\n    indicated by white arrows in green lanes.

The key feature of this type of\ninterchange is that trafﬁc on the overpass crosses over to the opposite side of the\nroad at one trafﬁc-signal controlled ramp and then returns to the proper side at the\nnext trafﬁc-signal controlled ramp. The crossover allows higher volume left-turn trafﬁc\nto proceed with little disruption or interruption.\n\nWhen you encounter this type of intersection:\n• Watch for lane designation signs as well as pavement markings to guide you into the\n  correct lane (see “Lane selection,”page 35).\n• Trafﬁc going straight – watch for lane designation signs and ensure you’re in the\n  correct lane to proceed straight. After the trafﬁc lights, don’t panic; you will be\n  crossing onto the opposite side of the road for a short distance before crossing\n  back onto the proper side at the next trafﬁc lights.\n• Trafﬁc turning left – watch for lane designation signs and ensure you’re in the\n  correct lane to turn left. After the trafﬁc lights, don’t panic; you will be crossing onto\n  the opposite side of the road for a short distance before making your left turn.\n• Trafﬁc turning right – normal right-hand turn procedures apply, so watch for lane\n  designation signs and ensure you’re in the correct lane to turn right.\n\n\n\n\nTrafﬁc going straight\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.19 Interchanges\n\n\n\n\n    Trafﬁc turning left\n\n\n\n\n    Trafﬁc turning right\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.19 Interchanges\nRestricted Crossing U-Turn\nThe Restricted Crossing U-Turn (RCUT)\nintersection (also known as a reduced\nconﬂict intersection) is designed to\ndecrease collisions caused by motorists\nattempting to cross a four-lane divided\nhighway.\n\nAt an RCUT intersection, drivers always\nmake a right turn, followed by a U-turn.\nMotorists approaching a divided highway\nwith an RCUT intersection are not allowed\nto make a left turn or drive straight through\nto cross the divided highway. Instead,\ndrivers must do the following:\n\n1. Using the entrance ramp, make a right\n   turn into the acceleration lane to enter\n   the highway.\n2. When it is safe to do so, signal, check\n   your mirrors, shoulder check and\n   change lanes into the far-left lane to\n   enter the U-turn lane.\n\n\n\n\n3. Complete the U-turn into the\n   acceleration lane going the opposite\n   direction.\n4. When it is safe to do so, signal, check\n   your mirrors, shoulder check and\n   change lanes into the far right driving\n   lane to continue straight or into the far\n   right turning lane to complete a right\n   turn.\n5. Remember to shoulder check when\n   changing multiple lanes.\n\n\n\n\n             This is a general representation\n              of the intersection. Actual layout\n              dimensions and lengths may\n              differ from this image.\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.20 Highways • 3.21 Pedestrians\n\n\n\n    3.20 Highways\n    Driving to the left of centre\n    You may not drive to the left of the roadway centre on two-way streets, roads or\n    highways unless it’s safe and there’s no trafﬁc approaching.\n\n    One-way highways\n    You may not travel in the wrong direction on a one-way highway.\n\n    Divided highways\n    Travel in the right hand driving lane and only use the left lane for passing, turning left\n    or emergency manoeuvers.\n\n    Controlled access highways\n    In the case of controlled access highways or freeways, you may not enter or leave\n    except at the exit or entrance provided.\n\n\n    3.21 Pedestrians\n    When approaching an intersection, you must yield the right of way to any pedestrians\n    who are crossing the street.\n\n    You must stop your vehicle before the crosswalk, which will either be painted on the\n    road or be an imaginary extension of the sidewalk. If a trafﬁc light changes while a\n    pedestrian is in the crosswalk, the pedestrian has the right of way.\n\n    You must stop your vehicle when directed to do so by a school crossing guard\n    controlling a crosswalk.\n\n    You may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an intersection to permit pedestrians\n    to cross.\n\n    As a pedestrian, you must not attempt to cross at an intersection unless you have\n    given motorists a chance to stop.\n\n    Pedestrians walking along a road should walk on the left shoulder, facing oncoming\n    trafﬁc.\n\n    Note: Pedestrians also include persons in wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs and\n    medical scooters.\n\n    Jaywalkers\n    Jaywalking is when a pedestrian crosses a roadway in violation of trafﬁc laws, typically\n    when crossing outside of a marked or unmarked intersection.\n    You must always be prepared to stop if you see a pedestrian who is about to step out\n    in front of you. But don’t encourage jaywalking by stopping and inviting pedestrians to\n    cross. The car behind you may not be expecting you to stop and may collide with you.\n    Also, drivers in the other lanes might not see the pedestrian crossing in front of your\n    vehicle and may hit them.\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road\n3.22 Crossing urban streets • 3.23 Wheelchairs and medical scooters\n3.22 Crossing urban streets\nYou may drive across a street only at an intersection, lane or alley.\n\nNote: In some cities, crossing a street at a lane or alley is prohibited by a local bylaw.\n\n\n3.23 Wheelchairs and medical scooters\nThe rules of the road that apply to pedestrians also\napply to persons using a wheelchair, motorized\nwheelchair or medical scooter for medical reasons.\n\nWhen approaching an intersection, you must yield the\nright of way to any person crossing the street who is\nusing a wheelchair, motorized wheelchair or medical\nscooter. This does not apply to wide streets if the\nperson in the wheelchair is at a safe distance from\nyour side of the street.\n\nYou must stop your vehicle before the crosswalk,\nwhich will either be painted on the road or be an\nimaginary extension of the sidewalk.\n\nYou may not pass any vehicle that is stopped at an\nintersection to permit persons using wheelchairs,\nmotorized wheelchairs or medical scooters to cross.\n\nPersons in wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs or medical scooters must not attempt\nto cross at an intersection unless they have given motorists a chance to stop.\n\nThe sidewalk should always be the ﬁrst choice while using a wheelchair, motorized\nwheelchair or medical scooter. When there is no wheelchair accessible curb, get onto\nthe sidewalk using the ﬁrst available driveway.\n\nLike pedestrians, persons using wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs or medical\nscooters travelling along a road where no sidewalk exists should travel on the left\nshoulder, facing oncoming trafﬁc. Wheelchairs, motorized wheelchairs or medical\nscooters should also have a brightly coloured ﬂag attached to increase visibility to\nmotorists.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n      3.24 Motorcycles • 3.25 Medians\n\n\n\n    3.24 Motorcycles\n    Although two motorcycles are permitted to drive in the same trafﬁc lane, it’s not\n    recommended practice to operate directly alongside another motorcycle.\n\n    Motorcycles may not travel beside any other type of vehicle in the same lane.\n\n\n\n\n        Incorrect                                   Correct\n\n    Drivers and passengers must wear an approved motorcycle helmet.

Thoroughfares lead into, through or out of a\nparking lot and aren’t used for vehicle parking. Parking lanes and passageways within\na parking lot must yield to thoroughfares.\n\n\n\n\nIn the above illustration:\n• Car A must yield to the car on its right, Car B.\n• Car C must then yield to the vehicle in the thoroughfare, Car D.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road\n\n\n\n    It’s advisable to have your lights on at all times because studies show that vehicles\n    driven with lights on at all times are much less likely to be involved in collisions than\n    those operated with their lights on at night only.\n\n    The law requires the use of headlights from half an hour after sunset until half an hour\n    before sunrise, and at any time when visibility is poor.\n\n    Note: Some vehicles do not have tail lamps on when daytime running lights are\n    being used. Always ensure you turn your headlights on at night, as it’s dangerous to\n    operate a vehicle at night without them or your tail lamps illuminated.\n\n    When using high beams, you must dim\n    your headlights at least 200 m (650 ft.)\n    in advance of oncoming vehicles and\n    keep them dimmed until the vehicle has\n    passed.\n\n    Many drivers make the error of dimming\n    their headlights too soon for oncoming       Low beams\n    vehicles. For example, when driving\n    at 100 km/h, you may not have to dim\n    your high beams until the approaching\n    vehicle is about seven to eight seconds\n    away from you, but a realistic approach\n    is to dim your lights between nine and\n    12 seconds away.\n\n    While you need to see the road, you          Low beams\n    shouldn’t blind the oncoming driver with\n    the glare of your lights. You may ﬁnd\n    that some drivers approaching you will\n    signal you to lower your lights while they\n    are up to 20 seconds away. This applies\n    to vehicles you are meeting and vehicles\n    you are following. To avoid blinding\n    other drivers, make sure your headlights\n    are properly adjusted and are in working     High beams\n    order.\n\n\n\n\n Basic information and rules of the road",

This glare recovery time tends to increase\nwith age to the point where it sometimes takes up to 25 seconds to recover. If\nyou suspect you have a glare recovery problem, check with an ophthalmologist or\noptometrist.\n\n\nDriving at night is difﬁcult because the area illuminated by your headlights is not all\nyou need to see. Motorcycles, cyclists, pedestrians and wildlife are particularly difﬁcult\nto see under these conditions — watch closely for them. If street lamps provide\noverhead lighting, you can see well ahead. If not, you must rely on your headlights.\nWhile driving at night, you should be able to see about 12 seconds travelling distance\nin front of you. This means that most of the time, you should be using your high beam\nheadlights and be looking beyond the part of the road illuminated by your lights.\n\nTo reduce glare from other vehicles or lights to the rear, adjust your mirror or use\na day-night mirror turned to “night.” Dimming the dash lights will also improve your\nability to see the road.\n\n\n\n\n 3     Basic information and rules of the road",

Traﬃc signs and signals\n    4.1 Trafﬁc signs\n    Many collisions and near crashes occur as a result of drivers who ignore or fail to\n    respond appropriately to trafﬁc signs. It’s essential that the meaning of trafﬁc signs\n    be interpreted correctly. Signs are classiﬁed according to their function such as\n    regulatory, warning and information.\n\n    The easiest way to identify trafﬁc signs is to learn to recognize their shapes and\n    colours. For safe driving, you must recognize and obey trafﬁc signs without hesitation.\n\n    A sign-conscious driver is a safe driver. Keep a constant look-out for signs as you\n    move your eyes in the ﬁeld of view ahead of you.\n\n\n    4.2 Six basic sign shapes every driver must know\n\n                           Stop\n                           The stop sign, a red octagon with white lettering, means come\n                           to a full stop and be sure the way is clear before proceeding.\n\n\n\n                           Regulatory\n                           Regulatory signs are white rectangles or squares with black\n                           or other coloured lettering.

Always proceed with caution\n    when crossing railway tracks.\n\n    Never get trapped on a crossing\n    When trafﬁc is heavy, wait on the approach to a crossing until\n    you’re sure you can clear it.\n\n    When the last car of a train passes the crossing, do not\n    start up until you’re sure no train is coming on another track,\n    especially from the other direction.\n\n    Never race a train\n    Racing a train to the crossing is foolhardy.

Basic driving skills\n    5.1 Hazards\n    A hazard is a source of danger. When driving, it’s something that forces you to change\n    your speed (usually to slow down) or change your steering (usually to steer around it)\n    to avoid a collision.\n\n    Real and potential hazards\n    A real hazard is something that you have to react to. Examples of real hazards are: a\n    stop light, a car moving slowly or stopping in your lane, a curve that requires you to\n    slow down, a pedestrian or vehicle blocking you.\n\n\n\n\n    Real hazard\n\n    A potential hazard is something that might happen and you may have to react to: a car\n    signalling the intention to change lanes, a car on the shoulder that might pull out, a\n    pedestrian who might cross the road or a trafﬁc light that might change.\n\n\n\n\n    Potential hazard\n\n    These two types of hazards will be referred to frequently in the following sections.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.2 The IPDE method of driving\n5.2 The IPDE method of driving\nWe use the IPDE (Identify, Predict, Decide, Execute) approach to driving to deal with\npotential and real hazards. IPDE deﬁnes the four steps involved.\n\n           Identify              Predict           Decide              Execute\n\nIdentify\nThe ﬁrst step to good driving and avoiding collisions is to identify, well in advance, real\nand potential hazards.\n\nFrom the thousands of objects in your ﬁeld of vision, you must learn to ﬁlter out those\nthat do not provide you with information relevant to the driving task. For instance,\nalthough a red neon sign attached to a restaurant may catch your eye, it’s an\nunnecessary distraction because it’s irrelevant to the driving task. You must search\nfor real or potential hazards (such as trafﬁc lights or children) and give them your\nimmediate attention.\n\nTo use this information the hazard must be spotted in plenty of time. That’s why your\nwindows need to be clear.\n\nPredict\nStep two is to predict what will happen should you encounter a real or potential\nhazard.\n\n\n\n\nReal hazards\nFor a real hazard, such as a red light, stop sign or a stopped vehicle, you simply\npredict whether or not the trafﬁc light will change or the vehicle will remain stopped.\n\nYou usually see real hazards in plenty of time and will have few problems predicting\nwhat will happen. Although you may be scanning the road properly, a vehicle may\nsuddenly stop right in front of you. You will then have to quickly predict what may\nhappen in the next few seconds.\n\nPotential hazard\nEvery vehicle you share the road with is a potential hazard. Be aware of where other\ndrivers could go. Make your best prediction of what they’re likely to do and keep\nrevising this prediction as you move towards them. Pedestrians, cyclists or children on\nthe side of the road are often potential hazards.\n\nPredict the path of potential hazards. The vehicle may make a right turn. The child may\nrun across the road.\n\nThe more often you practise predicting what may happen and what pedestrians and\nother drivers might do, the quicker you’ll be able to make accurate predictions.\n\n\n 5        Basic driving skills\n         5.2 The IPDE method of driving\n\n\n\n    Decide\n    Step three is to decide exactly what you’ll do to drive smoothly and deal with the\n    hazard. This means planning your actions in detail and checking to see that the way is\n    clear to proceed.\n\n    Real hazards\n    You may decide to simply brake gently or change lanes to avoid the hazard, or you\n    may want to brake hard, release the brakes and steer.\n\n    Potential hazards\n    When you encounter a potential hazard, you may decide to take no action and\n    continue to monitor the actions of other drivers, or you may decide to take action to\n    avoid the other vehicles.\n\n    Consider the following steps before you take any action:\n    1.    Check that your chosen gate is still open.\n    2.    Check the surface condition of the roadway for braking.\n    3.    Check the shoulder and the ditch.\n    4.    Continue to watch the vehicle and decide whether you will take action to avoid it.\n\n\n\n\n    Execute\n    The ﬁnal step, to execute, means to carry out your decision.\n\n    Executing some of your decisions will simply mean making a smooth stop at a\n    trafﬁc light.\n\n    Executing other decisions may involve using techniques for emergency driving.\n\n    To be good at executing your decisions, particularly emergency decisions, you need\n    to practise in a safe situation, preferably with a trained instructor. Practice helps you\n    overcome the panic that usually arises the ﬁrst time you’re in an emergency.\n\n    Practice makes perfect\n    When you begin practising the IPDE method you’ll be slow and will probably think in\n    words. As you practise, you’ll become faster and begin to think in ideas and pictures.\n    At this stage, you will be able to carry out the entire procedure rapidly. You can cut\n    your reaction time by taking the time to practise the IPDE method. It may save your\n    life.\n\n    Once you have been using IPDE for some time, much of your identifying, predicting,\n    deciding and executing will be carried out instinctively.\n\n    You’ll need to use IPDE more often in heavier trafﬁc and when you are driving at\n    higher speeds.\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.2 The IPDE method of driving • 5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nYou’ll ﬁnd that your physical condition greatly affects your ability to handle IPDE. If\nyou’re tired or ill, you should reduce the IPDE load by travelling at reduced speeds.\nYou can reduce the IPDE load by avoiding heavy trafﬁc. You might also consider not\ndriving.\n\nAlcohol and other drugs make it very difﬁcult to carry out the IPDE process. Since\nIPDE is designed to prevent you from having collisions, it’s not surprising that a large\nnumber of crashes are alcohol-and drug-related.\n\n\n5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nIt’s difﬁcult to judge how far things are ahead of you. It’s even more difﬁcult when\nboth your vehicle and the object outside the vehicle are moving. For example, can you\njudge how far away an approaching car is?\n\nWe all have internal clocks. We all have an internal awareness of time. Why not use\ntime to measure how far ahead things are in day-to-day driving? You can do this by\ncounting seconds.\n\nTo count time in seconds, say out loud, “thou - sand one, thou - sand two, thou -\nsand three,” at a normal speaking rate without pausing between the numbers. This will\ngive you a reasonably accurate count of three seconds.\n\nPractise checking against your watch; you’ll be counting off perfect seconds in\nno time.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.3 Time – the key to judgment\n\n\n\n    The language of time\n    The most important skill in driving is being able to use your eyes effectively to seek\n    out the information you need to drive. To use time as the basis for all of your driving,\n    with special emphasis on your eye use, you need to understand the different ways of\n    estimating time.\n\n    First, you must be able to estimate, while you are driving, how far stationary objects or\n    ﬁxed distances are from you. For example, the sign is nine seconds away and at 100\n    km/h the spaces on the broken lines on the highway disappear about 12 seconds\n    ahead.\n\n    Estimate distance ahead in the\n    following way:\n    1. Pick a stationary object that is on or\n       near the road (for example: a sign,\n       shadow, overpass or pavement\n       patch).\n    2. Guess how many seconds the\n       object is ahead.\n    3. Then start counting “thou - sand\n       one, thou - sand two, thou - sand\n       three,” etc.\n    4. When your front bumper is beside\n       the object, stop counting. This will\n       give you the number of seconds\n       between you and the object chosen.\n       If you guessed 15 seconds and\n       the distance ahead is really eight\n       seconds, then guess a lower number\n       next time. Try for longer distance;\n       see if you can guess how far away\n       40 seconds is. This way you’ll\n       improve your judgment.\n    5. Continue practising this exercise\n       until you can judge time accurately.\n    The relationship between time and distance varies with speed. Therefore, begin by\n    making all your judgments at the same speed. Then, practise at other speeds at which\n    you most commonly drive, say 100, 80 and 50 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nUsing time to estimate your following distance\nWhen you are driving, estimate the\ndistance between you and the vehicle in\nfront in the following way:\n\n1. Pick something that is on or near the\n   road and is not moving (for example,\n   a sign, pavement patch, shadow or\n   overpass).\n2. When the back bumper of the vehicle\n   ahead is even with the object you have\n   chosen, start counting – “thou - sand\n   one, thou - sand two, thou - sand\n   three,” etc.\n3. When your front bumper is beside the\n   object, stop counting. This will give you\n   the number of seconds between you\n   and the vehicle you are following.\n4. If you are closer than three seconds,\n   drop back and check again until you\n   have achieved a minimum of three-\n   seconds following distance. Any\n   following distance longer than that\n   is safe. However, a longer following\n   distance is recommended when\n   following a motorcycle.\n\nYou will notice that by keeping a three-second following distance, regardless of your\nspeed, the distance between you and the vehicle in front will automatically lengthen\nas you go faster. So, for a three-second following distance at 100 km/h, you will be\ntwice as far back as you would be at 50 km/h and four times as far back as you would\nbe at 25 km/h.\n\nTime – distance relationships\n          Speed                                       3-Second            12-Second\n                            Metres/second        Following Distance   Following Distance\n   km/h         MPH                                  (in metres)          (in metres)\n    100           62             28                     84                   336\n     90           56             25                     75                   300\n     80           50             22                     66                   264\n     70           43             19                     57                   228\n     60           37             17                     51                   204\n     50           31             14                     42                   168\n     40           25             11                     33                   132\n\n\n\n\n 5    Basic driving skills\n     5.3 Time – the key to judgment\n\n\n\n    For a three-second following distance at 100 km/h, you will be twice as far back as\n    you would be at 50 km/h.\n\n                      100 km/h                          50 km/h\n\n\n    There is one situation where a three-second following distance is not enough. If you\n    are following a large truck or van that blocks your view of trafﬁc ahead, drop back to\n    more than three seconds until you can see around the vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n        Incorrect\n\n\n\n\n        Correct\n\n    You may feel that if you try to keep a three-second following distance, other drivers\n    will cut into the space you leave. This will happen sometimes, but less often than you\n    think. To give up your sight distance, your planning and response time and relaxed\n    driving just because you want to save a few seconds and not let other drivers cut in,\n    is a poor bargain. If you let other drivers dictate your driving style, then you’re not\n    in control.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nThe three-second following distance is recommended when driving conditions are\nideal. If driving conditions are less than ideal, your following distance should increase\naccordingly.\n\nTo understand why, you will need to examine how three seconds would be spent in a\nsituation that could turn into a collision.\n\nFirst, you’ll spend some of the three seconds identifying the problem, predicting the\noutcome and deciding what to do, through the IPDE approach to driving. Then you\nneed some reaction time – to get your foot off the accelerator and apply the brake. If\nyou’re reasonably alert, you can do all of this in three seconds and begin braking, too.\n\nIf you stop at the same rate as the vehicle ahead, you‘ll not hit it.\n\nBut, if the driver in front hits a ﬁxed object; you’re tired and are slower to react than\nthe other driver; the other vehicle has better traction; or, the other driver is more\nskilled at braking than you are, then you need more than three seconds to avoid a\ncollision.\n\nHowever, if you’re looking ahead as far as you should, you’ll see the cause of the\nproblem any time from 12 to 60 seconds ahead – possibly before the driver ahead\nof you sees it. In this case, you can respond to the problem rather than to the brake\nlights of the vehicle in front of you.\n\n\n\n\n     Identify\n\n\n\n\n                     Predict            Decide\n\n\n\n\n                                                           Execute\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.4 Eye use\n\n\n\n    5.4 Eye use\n    Of all your senses, your eyesight is the most important for driving. Your eyes pick up\n    most of the information you need to drive.\n\n    Steer where you look\n    It’s important to understand that your eyes determine the path your vehicle follows\n    – you steer where you look.\n\n    To illustrate this, pick a straight stretch\n    of paved highway with light trafﬁc.\n    While driving, look at the centre line\n    about 12 seconds ahead. Keep looking\n    at the centre line 12 seconds ahead.\n    Observe how the car moves toward the\n    centre line.\n\n    Now, look at the edge of the road\n    12 seconds ahead.\n\n    You will steer where you look.\n\n    To steer straight ahead, look about\n    12 seconds directly ahead of where\n    you are sitting.\n\n    To steer around a curve, look at the\n    inside of the curve to where the centre\n    lines vanish. Do not look in the mirrors,\n    don’t look down at your instrument\n    panel. If you take your eyes off the road,\n    you will not maintain precise control\n    over your steering.\n\n    Remember, if you look at the side of the\n    road, you’ll steer to the side of the road.\n    Look where you want to go, particularly\n    in an emergency or a skid, and steer\n    there.\n\n    Check your mirrors and speed when\n    you’re driving in a straight line, and\n    when steering is less critical.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.4 Eye use\nSearch patterns on highways and rural roads\nWhen you drive on a highway, you hope the road is clear and unobstructed. To verify\nthat, you’ll need to perform a search pattern – searching the road for any obstructions\nor hazards.\n\nLooking up on highways\nAs part of your search pattern, look up as far as you can see. To look up means to\nlook as far ahead as you can see the highway – to the horizon (on a straight road, you\nmay be able to see up to 90 seconds ahead).\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.4 Eye use\n\n\n\n    On a curve, look up across and around as far ahead as you can see. At ﬁrst, you’ll\n    likely have to concentrate to look this far ahead in curves.\n\n    When curving right, look at the shoulder line to the point where it disappears. Keep\n    looking at that point and maintain a steady speed. When curving left, look at the\n    centre line as far as you can see it. When coming out of the curve, look at your lane all\n    the way to the horizon.\n\n    As you develop that “far ahead” view, you’ll automatically drive the curve smoothly and\n    accurately. You’ll also beneﬁt from seeing your path far enough ahead to deal with any\n    obstacles in your path.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.4 Eye use\nReferencing down on highways\nReference down by moving your eyes down from the look up position so that you see\nthe road 12 seconds ahead at 100 km/h.\n\nLook on the road in front of you to where the spaces on the broken lines on the road\ndisappear. This will be about 12 seconds away. This will help you obtain information\nyou require to steer accurately and safely.\n\nUntil now, you have been looking up (to the horizon), referencing down (12 seconds\nahead), looking up, referencing down, etc.\n\nWhen most people try this exercise, they usually ﬁnd that they have not been looking\nup as far as they can see. Also, they have usually been referencing down much closer\nthan 12 seconds.\n\nTo establish search patterns of up to 90 seconds ahead and to stretch your\nreferencing down to 12 seconds requires two things. First, most drivers must admit\nthat they haven’t been looking far enough ahead. Second, you have to practise to\nmake looking up and referencing down a habit.\n\nAs you establish the habit of looking up and referencing down, you’ll see the beneﬁts\nto your driving, and this method will become easier every day. Also, steering where\nyou look will help you overcome steering problems such as wandering within a lane or\nwandering from lane to lane.\n\n\n\n\nSweeping highways with your eyes\nThe next part of your search pattern is to look for things that will interfere with your\npath – vehicles entering from the side, animals or people on the side of the road, or\napproach roads. This involves sweeping your eyes across and to the side of the road.\nTry to sweep about 12 seconds ahead.\n\nFilling in the gap on highways\nNow ﬁll in the gap between you and where you reference down 12 seconds ahead.\nCheck the vehicles in front, the road surface for ice or pot holes, and the width and\nﬁrmness of the shoulders.\n\nChecking your gates on highways\nNext, you need to check which gates are still open; that is, the space around your\nvehicle on all four sides. Pay close attention if you have detected a real or potential\nhazard. Check your mirrors often to see whether the rear and two side gates are\nopen.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.4 Eye use\n\n\n\n    Checking your instruments on highways\n    You should check your instruments when it’s safe to take your eyes off the road. Even\n    checking your speed takes one and a half seconds. Therefore, check your instruments\n    when you’re on a straight stretch of road with your gates open and with no real or\n    potential hazards ahead.\n\n    Check your speed and, less often, glance at your gas gauge and other instruments or\n    warning lights.\n\n\n\n\n    Now your pattern should be: look up, reference down, look up, reference down,\n    sweep left, sweep right, look up, reference down, ﬁll in the gap, look up, reference\n    down, check your gates, look up, reference down, check instruments, etc.\n\n    The exact sequence that you use will vary with the features and the trafﬁc on the\n    highway. The most important part of the sequence is to look up and reference down.\n    Include the others as needed. The more often the situation changes around you, the\n    more often you have to search.\n\n    Search patterns in urban areas\n    The pattern for city driving is similar to that of highway driving. It‘s not easy to achieve,\n    but is worth practising.\n\n    Looking up in urban areas\n    To look up in an urban area, look ahead as far as you can see – usually several\n    trafﬁc lights or a number of blocks ahead. This will give you information about the\n    ﬂow of trafﬁc, the sequence of the lights and whether there is construction or major\n    obstructions ahead.\n\n    Referencing down in urban areas\n    Next in the sequence, you should reference down. To reference down in an urban\n    area, move your eyes down from the look up position so that you view the road 12\n    seconds ahead at city speeds. Even if you cannot see clearly for that distance, you\n    should look around or through the windows of the vehicles ahead. Try to see cars well\n    ahead that are slowing down, changing lanes, turning or stopping. Watch for brake\n    and signal lights.\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.4 Eye use\nSweeping with your eyes in urban areas\nIn the city you need to sweep further to each side and sweep more frequently than\nyou do on the highway.\n\nThe sequence now should be: look up, reference down, look up, reference down,\nsweep left, sweep right, look up, reference down, etc.\n\nFilling in the gap in urban areas\nYou need to ﬁll in the gap between you and where you reference down, 12 seconds\nahead. In the city, you need to do this more often than on the highway because you\ndo not have as clear a view ahead.\n\nChecking your gates in urban areas\nYou need to be more aware of the status of your gates when driving in the city\nbecause vehicles are more likely to be in your blind spot.\n\nNever permit yourself to drive in a situation where there are fewer than two gates\nopen. If you cannot control the rear and side gates, at least you can drop back and\ndouble the distance between you and the vehicle ahead – to ﬁve or six seconds.\n\nChecking your instruments in urban areas\nYou’ll have little time to check your instruments when driving in the city. From time\nto time, check your speed. But remember to do this in light trafﬁc or on straight,\nunobstructed roads. You can check your gauges at trafﬁc lights and stop signs.\n\nSearch patterns at night\nAt night, your search pattern is much the same as it is during the day. You should look\nup and reference down to about 12 seconds ahead. This means that most of the time\nyou’ll be looking beyond the part of the road illuminated by your lights.\n\nYou still need to sweep with your eyes, ﬁll in the gap and check your gates and\ninstruments.\n\nDo not look at the side of the road because you will steer there. Obviously, don’t look\nat oncoming headlights because the glare will blind you. Look 12 seconds ahead,\ndirectly in line with where you are sitting.\n\nSearch patterns in emergencies\nThe rule for where to look in emergencies is simple: look where you want to go and\nsteer there.\n\nIf you are sliding or skidding sideways, don’t look down, don’t look at the instrument\npanel and don’t look at what you might hit. Look where you want to go.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.4 Eye use\n\n\n\n    Preventing potential collisions\n    Most collisions occur at intersections and cross roads. To help you spot and prevent a\n    potential collision, use the following method.\n\n    Scenario:\n    You’re driving on a road towards an intersection and spot another vehicle approaching\n    the same intersection. You don’t know how fast the other vehicle is travelling or how\n    far away it is from the intersection. To help you determine if a collision is imminent,\n    maintain your speed and course, and turn your head to take note of the other vehicle’s\n    position in relation to you. Continue to maintain your speed and course for a few\n    seconds and check the other vehicle’s position again by turning your head. If the other\n    vehicle is still at the same position, you’re on a collision course. Start slowing down,\n    and be prepared to yield or stop to avoid a collision.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       collision\n\n\n            Slow down here.\n                Be prepared\n             to yield or stop.\n\n\n\n                                                       60°\n\n\n\n\n                                                       60°\n\n\n\n\n    It’s important to turn your head while looking for approaching vehicles and not rely on\n    your peripheral vision only. Peripheral vision is very good at picking out objects that\n    are moving; however, in the above scenario the other vehicle would appear to be not\n    moving as it’s in a ﬁxed position in your peripheral view.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.4 Eye use • 5.5 Before you drive\nDriving in dense trafﬁc\nIf you’re not accustomed to driving in\ndense trafﬁc, the experience can be\nhighly stressful. You can make it easier\nif you plan where you wish to go in\nadvance. It’s nerve wracking to drive in a\nnew environment and to try to navigate\nat the same time.\n\nThe most important thing to remember\nis don’t give up your following distance.\nDon’t stop your search pattern. If the\ndrivers around you are driving one\nsecond apart, let them, but don’t be\ntempted to follow their example.\n\n5.5 Before you drive\nVehicle familiarization\nMany drivers have collisions during their ﬁrst week of owning a new car because they\ndon’t know where the controls are.\n\nWhenever you get into a vehicle that is new to you, take time to ﬁnd out where the\ncontrols are. You must be able to operate the windshield wipers, windshield washers,\nhorn, lights, heater, radio, turn signals and hazard lights without looking at them. With\nthe vehicle stationary, practise looking at the road ahead while you reach and adjust\neach control.\n\nRead the owner’s manual. New vehicles have new design features that you should be\nfamiliar with if you’re to drive safely and get maximum enjoyment and efﬁciency from\nyour vehicle’s equipment. Visit mycardoeswhat.org to learn more about how to use\nsafety technology and features such as back-up cameras, lane departure alerts, and\nblind spot detection.\n\nBefore you drive check that:\n• doors are properly closed (if security is an issue, you may want to lock your doors)\n• all loose objects are secured\n• your seat is properly adjusted\n• head restraints are properly adjusted\n• mirrors are properly adjusted\n• air ﬂow regulators are adjusted (vents, heaters, air conditioning)\n• seatbelts are fastened and properly adjusted\n• bulbs in warning lights are working and the lights go out when the engine starts (see\n  owner’s manual)\n\nShould an engine or oil warning light come on while operating your vehicle, the cause\nshould be determined as soon as safely possible. Continuing to drive with a warning\nlight on may cause damage to the vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.5 Before you drive\n\n\n\n    Design components for safety\n    Vehicle designers must prevent injury and reduce the seriousness of injury in crashes\n    by building safety features into the design of every vehicle.\n\n    Important safety features include head restraints, seatbelts and airbags.\n\n    Head restraints\n    In some vehicles, the head restraints are built into the seat, while in others you have to\n    adjust them.\n\n    If your vehicle is hit from behind, or if you hit someone in front, you are much less likely\n    to suffer a whiplash injury to your neck if your head restraint is properly adjusted.\n\n    Adjust the height of the head restraint for each driver or passenger. The protection\n    afforded is well worth the effort.\n\n    Adjust the pad of the restraint to support the back of your head. The top of your head\n    restraint should never be lower than the top of your head.\n\n\n\n\n         Incorrect                                     Correct\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.5 Before you drive\nSeatbelts\nA safe passenger compartment is an important part of vehicle design. The front and\nrear of a car are designed to collapse on impact while the passenger compartment\nremains undisturbed. Your chances of survival are, therefore, greatly increased if you\nremain in the passenger compartment.\n\nYour seatbelt will keep you in your seat and will reduce the forces your body\nexperiences in a crash.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, every vehicle occupant must wear a seatbelt where they are\nprovided in a properly adjusted and securely fastened manner. Obey the law and\nincrease your chances of surviving a collision. Put on your seatbelt every time you ride\nin a vehicle. To be most effective, seatbelts must be used properly. First, put the lap\nbelt on, adjusting it to ﬁt over your pelvis, and pull it snug. The lap belt is designed to\ntake the force on your pelvis – not your stomach. Keep the lap portion low.\n\nNext, adjust the shoulder portion of the seatbelt over your chest area. How you do this\nwill vary from vehicle to vehicle. Some adjust automatically, others work like a window\nblind. Adjust your shoulder belt to make it snug, yet comfortable. Shoulder belts\nshould never be worn behind your back or under your arm.\n\n\n\n\nLap belt                                      Shoulder belt\n\nDrivers are legally responsible to ensure that passengers under 16 years of age use\nseatbelts where available and child safety seats, when appropriate. If not, the driver\nmay be charged. Passengers aged 16 years and older are responsible for buckling\nthemselves up.\n\nBeing a safety-minded driver means you make sure everyone in your vehicle is\nproperly secured. Without a seatbelt or proper child safety seat a passenger can\nbecome a dangerous ﬂying object during a collision.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.5 Before you drive\n\n\n\n    Car seats and booster seats\n    In Saskatchewan, children under seven years old must be properly ﬁtted into correctly\n    installed and approved car seats or booster seats for their size, weight, height and age.\n    This is to make sure their smaller bodies are kept safe and not seriously injured in a\n    collision. These seats belong in the back seat away from air bags. Children will not be\n    protected by a regular seatbelt alone until they are large enough and old enough, which\n    is usually age seven and when they weigh more than 36 kg (80 lb.).\n\n    Car seats or booster seats must be used no matter who is transporting the child,\n    including grandparents, caregivers and if they’re in a taxi or rideshare vehicle.\n\n    For more information on car seats, contact Trafﬁc Safety Community Outreach\n    306-775-6042 or 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744) or email trafﬁcsafety@sgi.sk.ca.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.5 Before you drive\nAirbags\nAlmost all vehicles are equipped with air\nbags. The tough fabric bags inﬂate in crashes\nover 16 km/h, cushioning an occupant’s neck,\nhead and chest in moderate to severe impact.\n\nChildren should never be put in the front\nseat of cars equipped with passenger-side\nairbags. The force of an airbag deploying is\nenough to critically injure or kill an infant or\nsmall child.\n\n\n\nAirbags are not a replacement for seatbelts. Seatbelts alone provide all the protection\na person needs in low and moderate-speed impacts. Airbags are most effective in\nhigh-speed crashes, where they often prevent serious injury.\n\nDriver-side and passenger-side airbags are common features in newer automobiles.\nAirbags are also installed in the doors of some cars to prevent passengers from\nhitting their heads against the windows or pillars of the car during a collision.\n\nOccupants must wear seatbelts to protect themselves in these circumstances and\nto ensure that in the event of a frontal crash, they remain in the seating position\nnecessary for airbags to be effective.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.5 Before you drive\n\n\n\n    Seating position\n    If you don’t sit properly, you cannot steer well nor can you use your brake or\n    accelerator efﬁciently.\n\n    The proper way to sit:\n\n\n\n\n    1. Sit up straight and well     2. Move the seat forward       With a manual transmission,\n       back into the seat.

The following page outlines an\nexcellent method to adjust your vehicle’s mirrors to maximize your view of the road.\nRemember, always adjust your mirrors before you start to drive.\n\nBegin with the rear-view mirror. Adjust the mirror so that you’re able to see as much of\nthe rear window as possible. While adjusting the mirror, aim to keep your head in the\nsame position as it will be when you are actually driving your vehicle.\n\nAdjusting your side mirror is a little more difﬁcult. First, lean to the left so that your\nforehead is barely touching the side window. Then move the mirror so you can just\nsee the left side of your vehicle.\n\nTo adjust the right side mirror, position your head toward the centre of your vehicle.\nAdjust the mirror so it shows just a sliver of the right side of your vehicle.\n\n\n\n\nBy setting mirrors so the driver can see both sides of the vehicle from the driving\nposition, the same image will appear in all three mirrors. By setting them so the driver\nhas to lean to see the sides of the car, the outside mirrors continue on where the\ninside mirror leaves off – signiﬁcantly reducing the blind spot.\n\nAnother advantage of positioning your mirrors this way is that it reduces headlight\nglare from vehicles travelling behind you.\n\nLeft foot brace\nThe left foot brace refers to the bracing of your\nleft foot against the ﬁre wall (located below and\nbehind the pedals separating the engine from the\ndriving compartment) to support you and to keep\nyou ﬁrmly in your seat.\n\nPlace your left foot against the ﬁre wall and\npush whenever you need stability such as\nwhen negotiating a curve, when braking, in an\nemergency or on slippery pavement.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.5 Before you drive • 5.6 Steering\n\n\n\n    Bracing with your left foot helps you steer easily and well because you are not leaning\n    on the wheel. Also, if you’re not supporting your weight on the heel of your right foot,\n    it is free to brake and accelerate with greater precision and control.\n\n    The fact that you need a left foot brace for controlled driving means you cannot use\n    your left foot to brake. Always brake with your right foot.\n\n\n    5.6 Steering\n    Hand positions\n    There are two correct hand positions on a steering wheel: “9 and 3” and “8 and 4.”\n\n\n\n\n    “9 and 3”                                    “8 and 4”\n\n    These methods refer to visualizing the steering wheel as the face of a clock, and\n    positioning the left hand at the 9 or 8 and the right hand at the 3 or 4 o’clock position.\n    Steering wheels and shoulder widths differ, so exactly where people grasp the wheel\n    will vary.\n\n    On a vehicle equipped with an airbag in the steering wheel, a hand placed on the\n    top of the wheel may be forced back into the driver’s face if the airbag is deployed,\n    causing injury.\n\n    Once your hands are in correct position, don’t shufﬂe them around on the wheel.\n    Keep your grip in the same place and simply twist the steering wheel to turn the\n    vehicle.\n\n    You can twist the wheel until your forearms touch. To steer beyond this point, you‘ll\n    have to use a “hand over hand” or “hand to hand” steering sequence.\n\n    The key to steering is to know the steering wheel position at which your front wheels\n    are straight. When you start out, straighten your front wheels and place your hands in\n    position. Provided that you don’t shift your grip, every time your hands are straight and\n    level, you know your front wheels are straight.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.6 Steering\n“Hand over hand”\nThis method is used when turning the wheel sharply either when driving slowly or in\nemergencies when conditions are very slippery.\n\nAs you turn the wheel, pull the wheel down with the top hand, take the bottom hand\nand put it up at the top, pull the wheel down with the top hand, take the bottom hand\nand put it at the top, etc.\n\nWhen unwinding the wheel after a turn, use the hand over hand system. Don’t let the\nwheel slide through your hands – you have very little control of the speed at which it\ncomes back or the point at which it stops.\n\n\n\n\n“Hand-to-hand”\nCommonly called push/pull steering or zone steering, when using the hand-to-hand\nsteering method, your left hand grasps the wheel between 7 and 8 o’clock, and your\nright hand between 4 and 5 o’clock. Depending on the direction you turn, your right or\nleft hand pushes the wheel up and the opposite hand slides up, grasps the wheel and\npulls down to turn.\n\nWhile the pulling hand moves down, the hand that initially pushed up slides back\ntoward its original position to make adjustments as needed. The driver should use\nthe area on the wheel between 11 and 8 o’clock with the left hand and the area on\nthe wheel between 1 and 8 o’clock with the right hand regardless of the direction of\nthe turn.\n\nSimply reverse the process to bring the vehicle back to the desired path. Since your\nhands never cross over the steering wheel, there is less chance of an injury to the\nface, hands or arms induced by your hands or arms in the event of a frontal crash due\nto an air bag.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.7 Accelerating • 5.8 Standard (manual) transmission vehicles\n\n\n\n    5.7 Accelerating\n    To move the vehicle smoothly and to save on fuel, push the accelerator down\n    gradually and wait for the vehicle to build up speed.\n\n    In vehicles with automatic transmissions, the gears will change automatically for\n    you. With manual transmissions, you have to release the accelerator and re-apply\n    accelerator pressure as part of your gear shift.\n\n    To drive with precision, you must vary the accelerator position smoothly by small\n    amounts. Accelerating too quickly can lead to a loss of control of the vehicle,\n    especially on gravel, snow or ice.\n\n\n    5.8 Standard (manual) transmission vehicles\n    Driving a vehicle with a standard (manual) transmission requires signiﬁcant practice\n    and skill. Drivers should read the vehicle owner’s manual for information speciﬁc to\n    their vehicle.\n\n    Neutral/clutch\n    • know your gear pattern so you are able to shift gears without looking at the gear shift\n    • take the engine’s rpm (revolutions per minute), choice of gear and road speed into\n      consideration when shifting gears\n    • shift gears in order (e.g., 2 to 3 to 4, or 4 to 3 to 2)\n    • never force a gear\n    • never coast in neutral\n    • never depress the clutch (riding the clutch) for extended periods of time. The clutch\n      should only be used when starting and stopping the vehicle, and to change gears.\n    • become familiar with accelerator and clutch timing. Poor timing from one to the\n      other can cause the vehicle to jolt, jump, stall or roll backward when starting on\n      a hill or slope.\n\n    You should shift to neutral (or declutch) during emergencies or when stopping\n    in winter driving conditions. This gives you better control over your vehicle by\n    disconnecting the engine from the drive wheels. If you’re stopping on a slippery\n    surface and are in neutral, then your drive wheels are not driving the car forward while\n    you are trying to stop. You stop more easily over a shorter distance.\n\n    To shift to neutral, declutch by pushing the clutch to the ﬂoor and hold it there, and\n    move the gear shift lever to neutral.\n\n    When parking a vehicle, ensure the vehicle is in (ﬁrst) gear, not in neutral, before\n    leaving the vehicle. This is to prevent the vehicle from freely moving forward or\n    backward while parked.\n\n    Standard (manual) transmission training is available from certain SGI certiﬁed\n    driver educators.\n\n    Use the Driver Educator locator at www.sgi.sk.ca/drivereducator for a list of SGI\n    certiﬁed driver educators.\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.9 Automatic transmission vehicles • 5.10 Low speed skills\n5.9 Automatic transmission vehicles\nMost vehicles on the road are equipped with automatic transmissions. An automatic\ntransmission placed in drive “D” is designed to change gears automatically without\nany driver assistance. This type of transmission selects the most efﬁcient gear based\non speed and acceleration.\n\nIt’s possible for the driver to make an automatic transmission shift by simply using the\naccelerator pedal:\n\nTo shift to a higher gear - ease up slightly on the accelerator.\n\nTo shift to a lower gear - push the accelerator to the ﬂoor. This technique is used for\npassing or to get out of an emergency situation quickly.\n\nWhen driving down a steep hill, you can slow your vehicle by manually shifting to a\nlower gear and using engine compression as a braking effect. Simply move the gear\nshift lever from the drive “D” position to the next lower gear (usually third or second\ngear). It is recommended to make your gear selection at the top of the hill before you\nstart going down. If you have to make the shift while driving down the hill, release the\naccelerator and use your brake to slow the vehicle down before moving the shift lever.\nTo avoid engine damage, pay attention to ensure that the rpm’s stay out of the red\nzone as you shift to a lower gear. You should use the brakes only as needed. Holding\nthe brake pedal for an extended length of time may cause the brakes to overheat,\nwhich can result in a loss of braking ability.\n\n\n5.10 Low speed skills\nSurprisingly, certain low speed skills can be quite tricky. You need to drive slowly to\npark, turn sharply, back up or move forward in trafﬁc jams.\n\nLow speed manoeuvring\nTo drive slowly in an automatic-transmission vehicle, rest your foot on the brake and\nlet the idling speed of the engine move the vehicle, braking as necessary to control\nthe speed.\n\nIn a manual-transmission vehicle, you control very low speeds almost entirely with the\nclutch. Accelerate as for a normal start and hold your engine speed constant. Raise\nthe clutch to the point at which the engine engages with the drive wheels, and stop.\nThen, ease the clutch up a small amount to move the vehicle. To gain speed, ease the\nclutch up a little more. To slow the vehicle, push the clutch down a small amount until\nthe engine is again disengaged from the drive wheels.\n\nIf the vehicle is on a slope and/or is moving faster than you wish, declutch and\nbrake gently.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.10 Low speed skills\n\n\n\n    Backing\n    You might think that being good at backing isn’t important. However, collisions while\n    backing are among the most frequent type of collision. This is due, in part, to drivers\n    who believe that a low-speed activity such as backing is no problem.\n\n    Best practices for safe backing\n    1. Check your surroundings:\n       • Always check behind your vehicle\n         before backing up.\n       • Children, pets, bicycles, wagons,\n         etc., aren’t always visible from inside\n         your vehicle.\n       • Make sure the path is clear before\n         you start backing up.\n    2. Prepare your vehicle:\n       • All backing manoeuvres should\n         begin with the vehicle straight and\n         the front wheels straight.\n       • Adjust your mirrors and ensure your backup camera (if equipped) is clean and\n         operational.\n    3. Using the backup camera:\n       • Check all angles — while backup cameras are helpful, they don’t capture\n         everything. Always turn your head to look out the rear window and check in all\n         directions.\n       • Mirrors and camera — use your mirrors in conjunction with the backup camera to\n         get a comprehensive view of your surroundings.\n    4. Proper positioning for backing:\n       • From your normal seating position, shift your weight so that you’re resting on\n         your right hip.\n       • Support yourself by placing your right arm along the armrest or the top of the\n         front passenger seat.\n       • Grasp the top centre (12 o’clock position) of the steering wheel with your left\n         hand.\n    5. Starting to back up:\n       • While looking out the rear window, begin backing slowly in a straight line. Within\n         the ﬁrst foot or so of vehicle movement, check forward. If the front of the vehicle\n         is moving straight back, your front wheels are straight. If the front of the vehicle\n         swings to the left or right, your wheels are not straight.\n       • If the front of your vehicle swings to the left, turn your steering wheel to the left\n         to straighten. If the front swings to the right, turn your steering wheel to the right\n         to straighten. Once you get the wheels straight, move your grip to the new 12\n         o’clock position.\n       • Having done this, you know that every time your hand is at 12 o’clock, your front\n         wheels are straight.\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.10 Low speed skills\n\n\n\n\n6. Focus and control:\n   • Look through the rear window and focus your eyes well back along the path you\n     want to go.\n   • Move the vehicle slowly backward. Look and steer where you want to go.\n   • You’ll notice that the vehicle turns much more when you are backing because\n     the front wheels are pivoting, or swinging, around the rear wheels. This is called\n     ‘front end swing’ and is the cause of many backing collisions.\n\nAdditional tips for using technology\n• Backup sensors: Many vehicles are equipped with backup sensors that alert you\n    if you’re getting too close to an object. Pay attention to these alerts but do not rely\n    solely on them.\n• 360-degree cameras: Some vehicles offer a 360-degree view, which can provide a\n    better overall perspective. Use this feature to enhance your situational awareness.\n• Blind spot monitoring: Utilize any blind spot monitoring systems to assist in\n    detecting vehicles or objects that you might not see when backing up.\nBy combining these technologies with proper visual search patterns and cautious\ndriving, you can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk of collisions while backing up. Remember,\ntechnology is there to assist you, but your primary focus should always be on visually\nconﬁrming your surroundings and backing up safely.\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.10 Low speed skills\n\n\n\n\n    Steering techniques for backing\n    1. Hand over hand and hand-to-hand\n       Shift your weight slightly onto your right hip, grasp the steering wheel with both\n       hands and use the hand over hand method to turn the steering wheel. While this\n       method provides good steering control, it limits your ability to see out the back\n       window. For the hand-to-hand method, refer to “5.6 Steering”.\n    2. Palming (precision backing technique)\n       Palming is an advanced steering technique that’s\n       only used when backing. It’s used in situations\n       where both straight line backing and sharp turning\n       are required. This method allows you to turn the\n       wheel sharply while ensuring that your front wheels\n       will be straight when your hand is at 12 o’clock.\n       Put your left hand at the 12 o’clock position but\n       do not grasp the wheel. Instead, push your palm\n       against the rim of the wheel with enough pressure\n       so that when you move your hand down and\n       around, the wheel turns, but your palm stays on\n       the same place on the wheel rim.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.1 Parking\n6. Advanced driving skills\n6.1 Parking\nParallel parking\nFirst, ﬁnd a space that you can ﬁt your vehicle into. Signal your intention to park to\nother drivers as you approach. If you’re not sure, stop your vehicle beside the space\nand check that you have at least 2 m more than the length of your vehicle. Shift to\nreverse as soon as possible to activate the back-up lights.\n\nThis is only one suggested method of parallel parking. There are others that work just\nas well.\n\n1. Position your vehicle parallel to the front vehicle about .5 m out from it, with your\n   back bumper lined up with the front vehicle’s back bumper. Shift to reverse, check\n   that the way is clear and get ready to steer.\n\n\n\n\n2. Back slowly. Immediately start turning your wheel toward the curb until you reach\n   about a 45 degree angle. (Pay attention to your vehicle’s front end swing into\n   trafﬁc. Make sure you are clear of oncoming vehicles.)\n\n\n\n\n3. Continue to back slowly and straighten your wheels.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.1 Parking\n\n\n\n    4. When your front bumper clears the bumper of the front vehicle, continue to move\n       slowly and turn your wheels away from the curb.\n\n\n\n\n    5. If necessary, shift to ﬁrst or drive, and slowly move forward while you straighten\n       your vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n    Back-up cameras\n    Driving assist options are becoming increasingly more standard on new vehicles.\n    However, they aren’t substitutes for proper driving techniques. In the case of back-up\n    cameras, the sun can interfere with the view as can snow, or dirt. Before reversing,\n    look over your shoulder and use your mirrors to check behind you. Shift into reverse\n    to activate the back-up camera. As you back up, check the monitor for objects while\n    being aware of your surroundings. Observe your mirrors and check or look through\n    the rear window. Don’t rely primarily on the monitor when backing.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.1 Parking\nAngle parking\nWhere a parking space is at 90 degrees (a right angle) to the road, as it is in most\nparking lots, it’s recommended that you back into the space, unless prohibited. You\nhave the advantage of being able to back in accurately because your windows are\nclear and you are warmed up for driving. In addition, the front end swing occurs in the\naisle, not between two parked cars and you’re backing into a space you know is free\nof obstacles instead of backing into trafﬁc. More importantly, when you drive out you\nwill have an excellent view.\n\n\n\n\nSome parking spaces are at about a 60 degree angle to the road. These spaces are\nusually located in small urban centres and on one-way streets. You’re meant to drive\ninto and back out of them.\n\n\n\n\nSteps in angle parking:\n1. Signal your intention to park and slow down.\n2. Check for approaching trafﬁc from the front and rear.\n3. Approach the stall approximately one vehicle width from the parked vehicles.\n4. When your vehicle’s front end is even with the rear of the stall you want to park in,\n    begin steering sharply to the right while slowly driving towards the centre of the\n    stall. Remember, as you’re turning into the stall, to check that you will not hit the\n    vehicle on either side of the stall.\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.1 Parking • 6.2 Turning\n\n\n\n    5. Once your vehicle is centred in the stall, straighten your wheels and continue driving\n        forward until you are completely in the parking stall. Although it’s easy to park,\n        backing out from this position can be hazardous. Shoulder check both your sides\n        and rear — don’t just rely on your rearview mirror. Make sure it’s clear behind and\n        on both sides before backing up. If your vision is blocked, for example, by a truck\n        parked beside you, move back cautiously and watch for pedestrians or vehicles\n        that you may not have seen.\n\n    Parking on a hill\n    The trick to parking on a hill is to turn your front wheels so that if the vehicle rolls\n    away, it will roll into the curb and stop. If there is no curb, the vehicle should roll off\n    the road, not into the path of other vehicles. This will prevent the vehicle from building\n    momentum and will stop it from entering the street. The emergency brake should be\n    applied whenever parking on a slope.\n\n\n\n\n      Downhill with curb          Uphill with curb         Downhill no curb   Uphill no curb\n\n\n    6.2 Turning\n    U-turns\n    A U-turn is when you turn your vehicle around at an intersection to travel in the\n    opposite direction. Before making a U-turn, check that:\n    • there are no signs prohibiting U-turns\n    • you have adequate sight distance so you have time to ﬁnish the turn before\n      encountering oncoming trafﬁc. For example, in a 60 km/h area, you need a sight time\n      of at least 20 seconds each way. In a 100 km/h area, you need 40 seconds sight\n      distance clear of vehicles each way\n    • you have enough room to make the turn in one swing\n\n    If there is any doubt whether a U-turn can be made safely and with minimal disruption\n    to trafﬁc, go around the block.\n\n    The procedure for making a U-turn:\n    1. Check that the turn is allowed and the way is clear.\n    2. Signal the turn and approach as you would a left turn.\n    3. Move very slowly. Turn the wheel into a full lock as soon as you can (use hand over\n       hand).\n    4. Once you are on full lock, slightly increase your speed.\n    5. Throughout the turn, check to see that the way is still clear (both ways).\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.2 Turning\n6. Complete the turn. Before the car is straight, start unwinding the wheel (hand over\n   hand).\n7. Straighten your front wheels.\n8. Proceed as normal.\n\nU-turns are prohibited at trafﬁc lights unless permitted by a sign.\n\n\n\n\nWhen making U-turns every effort should be made to complete the turn in the most\nextreme left driving lane.\n\nTwo-point turns\nBefore making a two-point turn, check that you have adequate sight distance so\nthat you have time to ﬁnish the turn before any possible vehicle conﬂict occurs. For\nexample, in a 60 km/h area, you need a sight time of at least 20 seconds each way. In\na 100 km/h area, you need 40 seconds sight distance clear of vehicles, each way.\n1. Well before the place where you wish to turn around, signal right, shoulder check,\n   position your vehicle in the right lane and slow down.\n2. Cancel the signal, proceed past the intersection, and stop your vehicle as far right\n   as possible.\n   You may also move to the far right after the intersection and stop your vehicle as\n   illustrated on the next page. Choose whichever method can be done most safely\n   given the trafﬁc ﬂow.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.2 Turning • 6.3 Highway driving\n\n\n\n\n    3. Signal right or turn on four-way ﬂashers. Check for trafﬁc.\n    4. Begin slowly backing up. When the rear bumper is even with the intersection, turn\n       wheels sharply to the right. Be careful that the front of your car does not swing out\n       into trafﬁc. As you back into the approach, straighten the wheels and stop.\n    5. Signal for a left turn, check for trafﬁc and proceed to make a left turn into the left\n       driving lane.\n\n\n\n\n    6.3 Highway driving\n    Highway driving requires rapid acceleration to build up speed over as short a time as\n    possible to minimize the difference in speed with other vehicles. It’s very important\n    that you have a good judgment of the amount of time you need to safely enter the\n    highway and that it matches the amount of time you actually have.\n\n    Some things to remember while highway driving:\n    • It takes a longer time to stop from higher speeds.\n    • Some drivers who have been driving for a number of hours can develop “highway\n      hypnosis.” They may not see your brake lights or turn signal. Be prepared to make\n      your movements obvious and for a potential slow reaction by other drivers.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.3 Highway driving\n• The higher the speed, the less the steering wheel needs to be turned and the sooner it\n  must be turned prior to a curve, in order to get the vehicle around the curve.\n• Don’t make any sudden movements of the steering wheel.\n• It’s safest to drive at the same speed as the other trafﬁc, provided that the other\n  trafﬁc is driving at a sensible speed for the conditions and within the speed limit.\n\nCruise control\nOn a long trip you can use the cruise control, if your vehicle is so equipped, to keep\nyour speed constant. Cruise control will save gas and make highway driving less\ndemanding. However, there are times when you should not use cruise control, such\nas in urban areas, on wet or slippery roads, in trafﬁc where the speed is highly variable\nor in any situation where your vision is restricted.\n\nRestricted access freeways\nA freeway is a multi-lane, divided highway, with restricted access. There should be no\ncyclists, pedestrians or hitchhikers. Regina’s Ring Road and Saskatoon’s Circle Drive\nare some examples of freeways.\n\nEntering a freeway\nThe key to entering a freeway is to increase your speed in the acceleration lane until it\nmatches the speed of the vehicles already on the freeway.\n\nYou also need to plan your merge:\n1. While on the entrance ramp, look at the freeway trafﬁc and determine where you\n   want to merge.\n2. Build up your speed in the acceleration lane as quickly as you can.\n3. Continue to check the spot where you want to merge.\n4. Signal, make your ﬁnal shoulder check and accelerate into the freeway lane.\n    Merging at less than freeway speeds can be dangerous.\n\n\n\n\nWhile on the freeway\nProvide a safe merge for other vehicles entering the freeway from access ramps\nby either moving left to free the right lane or by adjusting your speed. Drive in the\nright lane, or perhaps the centre lane, when there are three lanes. The left lane is for\npassing or may be used by faster vehicles when the trafﬁc is dense.\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.3 Highway driving\n\n\n\n    Keep looking up and referencing down to 12 seconds ahead so that you have\n    advance notice of any obstacles in your path. Maintain a three-second following\n    distance and keep at least two gates open at all times. When driving conditions are\n    not ideal, you should decrease your speed on the freeway accordingly to maintain\n    safe travel.\n\n    Leaving a freeway\n    When leaving a freeway, signal your intention and move into the deceleration lane.\n    Slow down in the deceleration lane, not on the freeway. Some deceleration lanes are\n    shorter than others, so watch your speed. When you exit a freeway, you are likely to\n    under-estimate your speed when you slow down.\n\n\n\n\n    If you miss an exit\n    If you miss an exit, don’t stop on the freeway. Don’t back up on the freeway. Continue\n    to the next interchange and return to the correct exit.\n\n    Emergencies on the freeway\n    If your vehicle starts to give you trouble, check your mirrors, signal, shoulder check\n    and pull over onto the nearest shoulder as quickly and safely as possible. Slow down,\n    turn on your hazard lights and stop on the shoulder as far right as possible.\n\n    Never stop your car on the travelled portion of the freeway. Don’t wait for your car to\n    stall on the freeway. At the ﬁrst sign of trouble, pull over safely. If possible, stay with\n    your car. If you must cross the freeway on foot, use extreme caution.\n\n    Turn on your four-way ﬂashers or raise the hood to alert other motorists you need\n    assistance. Be especially careful getting out of your car when stopped along a\n    freeway. If necessary, exit from the door away from the trafﬁc.\n\n    In some cities, you may encounter roadways that have some characteristics of a\n    freeway and some characteristics of a normal street. Be alert for unexpected trafﬁc\n    patterns.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.4 Passing\n6.4 Passing\nEstimation of safe passing time\nUsing time to estimate when you can pass is complicated, but it’s well worth the effort\nrequired to master it. You can practise passing safely and once you can judge time\nwell, you have a good method of judging when it’s safe to pass.\n\nYou can get all the information you need to make a passing judgment from two\nestimates: the estimate of your safe passing time and the estimate of the closing time\nbetween you and the approaching vehicle.\n\nThe ﬁrst step in developing your new technique is to ﬁnd out how long it normally\ntakes you to pass. This varies from 10 to 40 seconds depending on your vehicle, your\ntechnique and the difference in speed between you and the vehicle you are passing.\nTo ﬁnd your safe passing time, choose a divided highway or a two-way highway at a\ntime and place when trafﬁc is light.\n\nFirst, determine your passing time as follows:\n1. Follow the vehicle ahead at the same speed, but three seconds back. Note its speed.\n2. Check that you can see at least 40 seconds ahead, that there are no vehicles\n   coming the other way and that there are no intersections or solid lane markings.\n3. Begin counting “Thou - sand one, Thou - sand two” from the point you decide to\n   pass and begin to accelerate.\n4. Signal, and at a point where you still have good vision and can smoothly change\n   lanes around the vehicle ahead, move into the left lane.\n5. Continue in the left lane until you see the vehicle you have just passed in your\n   inside mirror. As you pull back into your original lane, signal right and continue your\n   acceleration. Do not decelerate as you change lanes.\n6. Continue counting until you have completed your pass. Stop your count when your\n   left rear wheel crosses the lane line (just as you are returning to your original lane in\n   front of the vehicle you have passed).\n7. The last number you say after “Thou - sand” is your measure of passing time in seconds.\n\nNext, build in a safety margin that you are comfortable with.\n\nFive seconds is a minimum safety margin. For example, if your passing time is 15\nseconds, add another ﬁve seconds for possible error. This will give you a cushion of\nﬁve seconds if the vehicle coming towards you is approaching faster than normal or if\nyour estimation is not accurate.\n\n\n\n\n   Start counting                     Safe passing time                      Stop counting\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.4 Passing\n\n\n\n    Your passing time + your safety margin = your safe passing time\n    Your safe passing time in this case is 20 seconds.\n\n    If you think about it, your safe passing time will also tell you the minimum sight\n    distance needed for safe passing, even if there is nothing coming the other way.\n\n    Try this several times at highway speeds varying the difference between you and the\n    vehicle ahead until you get a handle on what your safe passing time actually is.\n\n    Estimation of the closing time of two vehicles\n    This is similar to judging the time from ﬁxed objects except now you have a vehicle\n    coming towards you. The gap between you and the approaching vehicle will close\n    about twice as fast as if you were approaching a ﬁxed object.\n\n    Steps to estimate closing time:\n    1. Position your vehicle three seconds behind the vehicle in front.\n    2. Determine the point at which you could safely return to your lane if you were to\n       pass the vehicle in front – the safe return point. For example, watch a vehicle pass\n       and note where it pulls back into the driving lane.\n    3. When an approaching vehicle appears, start counting and continue counting until\n       the vehicle reaches the safe return point ahead of you. The last number you say\n       after “Thou - sand” is your measure of closing time.\n\n\n\n\n                        Safe return point                     Closing time\n\n\n    The safe/unsafe judgment\n    When you feel conﬁdent that you can estimate closing times reasonably well, practise\n    judging when it is safe to pass, then check by counting time. When a vehicle is\n    approaching, decide if it is safe to pass or not. Say “safe” or “unsafe,” then count\n    “Thou - sand one, Thou - sand two” – check the actual closing time against your safe\n    passing time to see if you were right. Keep practising until you can make the safe/\n    unsafe judgment with 100% accuracy.\n\n    There are two advantages to practising your passing judgment in this way. First, it is\n    completely safe because you never actually pass the vehicle. Second, your timing will\n    be based on the actual speeds of vehicles using the highway.\n\n    Be sure to keep the type and size of vehicle you are passing in mind. For instance,\n    when passing a motorcycle make sure you leave a greater distance between your\n    vehicle and the motorcycle you are passing, before pulling back into the driving lane.\n    It’s easy to underestimate how much room you should allow due to the smaller size of\n    a motorcycle.\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.4 Passing\nThe actual passing judgment\nNow practise what you have learned. When you judge that it is safe to pass, carry out\na passing manoeuvre.\n\nRemember:\n1. You have to build a minimum of a ﬁve-second safety cushion into your safe passing\n   time. Do not give this up under any circumstance.\n2. When you have enough experience with this method of estimation to be skilled and\n   comfortable with it, extend your range. Determine the safe passing time for different\n   situations, such as different speeds, surface conditions and longer vehicles such as\n   tractor trailers. The passing time will vary.\n3. Your safe passing time is also a measure of the shortest sight distance you need to\n   pass, even with no oncoming trafﬁc.\n4. Your passing time will vary with the speed difference between you and the vehicle\n   you are passing.\n\nBeing passed\nWhen you’re being passed:\n1.   Maintain your speed; do not speed up.\n2.   Slow down, move to the right of your lane and let them back into the lane.\n3.   If the driver passing you has misjudged, slow down and let them back into the lane.\n4.   When being passed by large trucks, you’re likely to be pushed around by the wind.\n     Just look where you want to go and your steering will take care of itself.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.5 Curves and corners\n\n\n\n    6.5 Curves and corners\n    The techniques for driving around curves and corners are basically the same. In a\n    curve or corner, the vehicle will want to go straight ahead while you want to turn. If\n    you’re going too fast, or if the road is slippery, the vehicle will win and you won’t get\n    around the corner or curve. Any speed or steering adjustments required while in the\n    curve should be very gradual to avoid losing control of your vehicle.\n\n    The most important part of driving a curve or corner is to slow down before you get to it.\n\n    To drive around a sharp curve or corner, follow this procedure:\n    1. Slow down. Take your foot off the accelerator and, if necessary, brake. It’s important\n       to brake in a straight line.\n    2. In a manual transmission vehicle, shift to a lower gear so that you have enough\n       power to accelerate through the curve or corner.\n    3. Use the vision techniques on page 90.\n    4. Use your accelerator gently until you reach the mid-point of the curve, pushing down\n       on the accelerator if you want the vehicle to go to the outside of the curve. Ease up on\n       the accelerator if you want the vehicle to go to the inside of the curve or corner.\n    5. Once you reach the mid-point of the curve, unwind the steering wheel and\n       accelerate out of the curve.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.6 Driving in mountains • 6.7 Grid, municipal and resource access roads\n6.6 Driving in mountains\nWhen driving in mountains, you will have shorter sight distances, so it’s important that\nyou look up, reference down and adjust your speed so that you can see at least 12\nseconds ahead.\n\nWhen you drive down mountains, you sometimes move faster than you wish. You’ll\nﬁnd that shifting to a lower gear will help you to slow down. As you travel down the\nmountain, brake very lightly and continuously. This method of braking is least likely to\noverheat your brakes.\n\n\n6.7 Grid, municipal and resource access roads\nSaskatchewan has a large network of roads connecting its main highways.\n\nThese roads present driving challenges which differ from provincial highways. Sight\ndistances may be shorter. There are no shoulders, curves are sharper and there are many\nT-intersections, which means that the road comes to an end, often with little notice.\n\nUnlike main highways, these roads are not designed to help you to get out of trouble\nif you happen to be travelling faster than the posted speed limit. The speed limits are\nto be taken seriously and should be regarded as maximums under ideal conditions.\nWhen there is no posted speed limit, the speed limit is 80 km/h under ideal\nconditions.\n\nGravel surfaces may cause problems. At times, the gravel may be deep and loose,\nmaking it difﬁcult to steer around curves. At other times there may be so little gravel\nthat you’re actually driving in dirt, which is very slippery when wet.\n\nWhen dry, gravel surfaces also create visibility problems. Every moving vehicle creates\nclouds of dust that make meeting and passing other vehicles very dangerous.\n\nRailway crossings, crossroads and farm entrances are more difﬁcult to see on these\nroads than when you’re driving on provincial highways that provide better sight\ndistances. You’re also more likely to encounter slow-moving farm vehicles, livestock\nand wildlife.\n\nDriving techniques for gravel roads\nDrive at a speed suited to the conditions. This means drive slowly. When you exit from\na provincial highway, slow down. Keep your eyes up. You need all the advance notice\nyou can get. Even though the main path on gravel is often in the centre of the road,\nit’s important to stay to the right of centre when approaching and navigating hills and\nblind curves to allow room for oncoming vehicles that you cannot see.\n\nTo steer in deep gravel, grasp the wheel ﬁrmly. Expect that the vehicle will wander.\nYou won’t steer as precisely as you do on pavement, so don’t ﬁght it by turning the\nsteering wheel too much – you could lose control.\n\nStay well back from dust clouds.\n\nAlways drive with your headlights on so that others can see you earlier than they\notherwise might.\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.8 Winter driving\n\n\n\n    When meeting large trucks or farm equipment, slow down and pull as far to the right\n    as possible. You may have to stop.\n\n\n    6.8 Winter driving\n    In Saskatchewan, it’s possible that you\n    could be operating your vehicle for at\n    least ﬁve months of the year in winter\n    driving conditions. It’s in this period,\n    from November to March, that most\n    collisions occur.\n\n    Snow, ice and freezing rain reduce\n    traction. Drifting and blowing snow,\n    fog, whiteouts, gas exhaust clouds and\n    frosted windows may severely limit\n    visibility.\n\n    The main cause of collisions in winter\n    months is failing to adjust to changing\n    conditions.\n    Before heading out, be sure to check the Highway Hotline at hotline.gov.sk.ca/map for\n    road conditions, and stay home if it says travel not recommended.\n\n    Preparing your vehicle\n    Winter conditions, plus the effects of extremely low temperatures, demand that a\n    vehicle be in top condition. For this reason, a pre-winter check is a necessity, and\n    in the end is less annoying and less costly than battery boosts, tows and being late.\n    Give special attention to your heater and defroster.\n\n    As well as getting a tune-up and adding antifreeze to your radiator, you would be wise\n    to have the following:\n    • snow tires\n    • block heater\n    • snow brush and scraper\n    • gas line antifreeze\n    • small snow shovel\n    • set of traction mats\n    • booster cables (know how to use them)\n\n    For out of town trips, add the following survival equipment:\n    • extra warm clothes (include footwear, mitts and hats)\n    • a supply of candles and matches\n    • tow chain or rope\n    • nourishing freezable food (raisins, nuts, candy)\n    • sleeping bags\n    • cellphone and charger cable\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.8 Winter driving\nPreparing to see and to be seen\nIf you cannot see through your windows, you should not drive. If your lights and\nsignals are to protect you, they must be visible. Before you drive, do the following:\n• brush the snow off your car.\n• scrape the windshield, rear and side windows.\n• clear your heater air intake (this is usually in front of the windshield).\n• clean your headlights, tail lights and signal lights.\n• be sure to clear your tissue boxes, sunglasses, papers, etc., away from defroster\n  outlets.\n• drive with your headlights on at all times. Even on a clear day, swirling snow makes it\n  difﬁcult to see and to be seen.\n\nDriving on slippery surfaces\nWinter traction problems require a number of changes from summer driving\ntechniques. The general rule for driving on slippery conditions is drive slowly.\n\nYou should not use cruise control on icy or slippery roads. This is even more important\nwhen the road may have black ice formed on it (a thin layer of transparent ice found\non the road or other paved surfaces).\n\nTraction varies tremendously with temperature changes. Icy roads will look just the\nsame at -2 C or -22 C, but will be far more slippery at the warmer temperature.\nWinter driving calls for special driving skills. This means gentle acceleration, gentle\nbraking and small, smooth steering movements.\n\nReduced traction means the grip between your tires and the slippery surface is\nfragile.\n\nIf you accelerate hard, you go beyond the amount of traction that is available and\nyour wheels spin. If you brake too hard and your wheels lock, you break the traction,\nwhich means that when you turn the steering wheel, the vehicle will not turn – it\nwill continue in the direction it was going when the wheels locked. If this occurs\non ice, your stopping distance changes. In most situations, locking four wheels by\npushing hard on the brakes will give you the shortest stopping distance. But on ice,\nespecially when it’s near the freezing point or if you are driving fast, you are better off\nto threshold-brake by pushing on the brake up to the point just before it locks. (See\n“Threshold braking,” page 129.)\n\nIf the surface is slippery, ﬂatten the corner or curve by positioning your vehicle in the\nleft side of your lane prior to making your turn.\n\nAs you enter the curve, gradually steer across the lane so that as you near the mid-\npoint of the curve the vehicle is near the right side of the lane with its wheels straight.\nAs you exit the curve, gradually steer back across the lane towards the left side. For\nleft curves, reverse the process. This will lessen the sideways force and reduce the\nchance that you will spin out. Slow entry into the curve is crucial or your vehicle may\nnot make it around the curve.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.8 Winter driving\n\n\n\n    Because there is reduced traction available for stopping and turning, reduce your\n    speed when conditions are wet or slippery. As well, give yourself a following distance\n    even longer than three seconds.\n\n\n\n\n    Never use cruise control when roads are wet or slippery.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.8 Winter driving\nHow to get moving\nYou can usually start moving on ice or packed snow by accelerating gently. If this\ndoes not work, or if you are on a slight downgrade, try moving in second gear.\n\nIf you’re stuck in deep snow, try rocking your vehicle. To do this, start forward, gently\naccelerate and you will move forward a little. When your wheels spin, immediately\nstop accelerating and hold the vehicle with the brake to stop it from rolling back.\nShift to reverse, release the brake and accelerate gently. You will move back. When\nthe wheels spin again, stop immediately. Repeat the forward-backward rocking\nmovement, increasing the distance you move each time until you gain sufﬁcient\nmomentum to keep moving ahead. Be sure the wheels have stopped turning before\nchanging gears to avoid damage to your transmission.\n\nSearch for traction. Look for sand or grit. Choose snow rather than ice. A small\nmovement to one side will often move you from a low traction icy patch onto snow or\nsand. This motion can usually be completed in your lane.\n\nHow to stop on slippery surfaces\n1. Shift to neutral (or declutch) before you brake.\n2. Brake early and gently using the threshold technique. (See “Threshold braking,”\n   page 129.)\n3. Again, search for the best traction and position your vehicle to take advantage of it.\n4. Allow extra space for other drivers to stop. They may not be as skilled as you, or\n   their traction may be worse.\n\nTemptations to resist\n1. Accelerating hard when you are passing.\n2. Using cruise control on wet or slippery roads.\n3. Forgetting that other drivers may not be making proper allowances for winter\n   conditions.\n4. Letting your gas tank drop below half full.\n\nWhiteouts\nWhiteouts occur when the sky, horizon and ground blend into one, making it\nvery difﬁcult to determine your position on the road. All shadows and distinctions\ndisappear, so that you can barely tell where the road ends and the ditch begins.\n\nThe ﬁrst snowfalls\nDuring the ﬁrst few snowfalls, drive very slowly and keep a ﬁve-second following\ndistance. It takes time to change from your summer driving patterns. Exaggerate your\ngentleness on your brake and accelerator pedals and you will stay out of the line-ups\nat the body shop.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.8 Winter driving • 6.9 Braking\n\n\n\n    Survival\n    Lives continue to be lost in Saskatchewan winter blizzards.\n\n    Dress warmly for long trips. Do not be deceived by the false comfort of a well-heated\n    car and wear indoor clothes on long journeys.\n\n    Before starting a long trip, listen to weather forecasts and pay attention to storm\n    warnings. If storms develop while you’re travelling, seriously consider stopping over in\n    a town or village, rather than continuing, when there is a possibility of being stranded.\n\n    If you are stranded:\n    1. Always stay with your vehicle.\n    2. Keep calm.\n    3. Lower your downwind-side windows slightly and open the heater air vent to get\n       fresh air into the vehicle.\n    4. Run the engine to get some heat, and to listen to news reports or charge your\n       cellphone but don’t run out of gas or drain your battery.\n    5. Keep your exhaust pipe clear of ice and snow.\n    6. Get into your emergency clothing before you get cold.\n    7. If necessary, use candles to keep warm. Be careful not to over-exert yourself by\n       shovelling or by pushing your vehicle.\n\n    Many people die when they leave their vehicles to walk for help in a blizzard. If you\n    stay with your vehicle, you have a better chance of surviving and are more likely to be\n    found.\n\n\n    6.9 Braking\n    The general procedure for braking is to begin early, apply light pressure and ease up\n    on the brake as the vehicle comes to a stop. Always brake with your right foot.\n\n    If you want to stop more quickly, push the brake down a little further. Remember, for\n    normal braking you control the stop by varying the pressure. Do not push the brake\n    down as far as it will go.\n\n    Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) – was introduced in the mid-1980s and has become\n    standard equipment on most newer vehicles. It was designed to help drivers maintain\n    some steering ability and avoid skidding while braking. In normal braking, ABS is not\n    activated. During hard braking, vehicles with ABS remain stable. The brakes do not\n    lock up, which means the driver has more steering control. How do you use ABS?\n    Press the brake ﬁrmly and do not release until the vehicle has stopped. Do not pump\n    your brakes; the ABS is doing it for you.\n\n    When the ABS is active, the brake pedal may pulsate and the car may shudder or\n    emit clunking noises. This can startle some drivers, causing them to release the brake,\n    but these things are normal and indicate the ABS is functioning properly.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.9 Braking\nYou may think that with ABS you can stop on a dime. This instantaneous stop is not\nrealistic. When braking on dry or wet roads your stopping distance will be about the\nsame as with conventional brakes.\n\nYou should allow for a longer stopping distance with ABS than with conventional\nbrakes when driving on gravel, slush and snow. This is because the rotating tire will\nstay on top of this low-traction road surface covering and effectively “ﬂoat” on this\nlayer.\n\nA non-ABS-braked vehicle can lock its tires and create a snow plow effect in front\nof the tires that may, in some cases, help slow the vehicle. These locked tires can\nsometimes ﬁnd more traction below this layer. It’s recommended you refer to your\nvehicle owner’s manual to become familiar with proper practices should your vehicle\nhave electronic stability control, traction control, or other safety features.\n\nThreshold braking\nIn threshold braking, you’re trying to use all the braking force available without locking\nthe wheels, i.e., you’re trying for the “threshold” just before lock-up.\nTo accomplish this, shift to neutral (declutch) and brake until you feel one or more\nwheels lock, then, ease up the brake slightly until the wheels are all rolling again.\nRe-apply pressure until you feel one of the wheels start to lock up, ease off slightly\nand continue this movement, tracking the threshold until you stop. As the vehicle\nslows, you can brake harder before lock-up will occur.\n\nThe more slippery the surface, the less you will be able to push the brake before a\nwheel locks.\n\nThe skill in threshold braking comes from being able to linger just short of lock-up.\nTo threshold brake well requires much effort and concentration. While it’s usually the\ntechnique of choice, it is almost impossible to do if you panic.\n\nFour-wheel lock braking\nWith this technique, you shift to neutral (declutch) and then hit the brakes very hard\nso that all four wheels lock at the same time. Since most cars aren’t designed to do\nthis, you need to stomp on the brake pedal and keep maximum pressure on the brake\nuntil you come to a complete stop.\n\nYour vehicle will travel in a straight line. If all four wheels do not lock at exactly the\nsame time, or if the surface under different tires varies, the vehicle may rotate a little\nbefore it ﬁnally stops. Even under the worst conditions (one wheel on ice, one wheel\non dry pavement), the vehicle will travel in a straight line, although it may revolve\naround a point in the middle of the vehicle.\n\nYou need very little pressure to lock the wheels on ice. As the traction increases, you\nmust increase the pressure to lock the wheels. On dry pavement, you really have to\nstomp on the brake to lock all four wheels simultaneously. You must also be seated\nsufﬁciently close to the brake pedal to get the leverage required.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.9 Braking • 6.10 Emergency driving\n\n\n\n    The four-wheel lock will produce the shortest stopping distance on all surfaces,\n    except glare ice. It’s also an ideal technique to use if you panic because stomping on\n    the brake is a natural reaction. Also, once you stamp on the brake, you do not have to\n    do anything except keep pressure on the brake.\n\n    If possible, try the four-wheel lock when you are with a trained instructor. Otherwise,\n    practise at low speeds (20 - 40 km/h) on a wet surface. If you try this procedure on\n    dry pavement, you may damage your tires, which is acceptable if you’re trying to avoid\n    a crash, but not recommended if you are just practising.\n\n\n    6.10 Emergency driving\n    If you use the proper search patterns and see things well in advance, you should\n    avoid most emergencies. However, as part of your IPDE method of driving, expect\n    that other drivers may sometimes proceed when they shouldn’t. This means that you\n    will have to execute your decision in a hurry if you are to avoid a collision.\n\n    In this section, you’ll deal with the techniques you need to control your vehicle\n    during the execution part of an emergency situation. To become skilled in emergency\n    techniques, you need to practise, if possible, with a trained instructor.\n\n    Where to look\n    The rule is simple! Look where you want to go and steer there. Don’t look at the tree\n    you want to avoid, look at the gap you want to get through.\n\n    Emergency braking techniques\n    Always try to brake in a straight line. Get your wheels straight and line up your vehicle\n    so that it can go straight ahead while you’re braking. Don’t try to brake when your\n    vehicle is turned – you could spin out. (See “Braking,” page 128.)\n\n    Emergency steering techniques\n    The difference between steering in an emergency situation and steering in a normal\n    driving situation is the speed and amount that you need to turn the wheel.\n\n    If you do skid and need to recover, turn the wheel to correct your direction of travel.\n    This method just takes practise. The difﬁcult part is knowing when your wheels are\n    straight.\n\n    At higher speeds, use the “9 and 3” steering method. (See “Hand positions,”\n    page 104.) Twist the wheel without moving your hands on the wheel. When your\n    hands return to “9” and “3,” you know your front wheels are straight.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.10 Emergency driving\n\n\n\n\nSteering around an object involves\nthree movements:\nSteer\nTwist the wheel in the direction you\nwish to go.\n\nCounter-steer\nTurn the wheel back the other way\nbeyond the centrepoint.\n\nStraighten out\nTwist the wheel back to the point\nwhere your wheels are straight.\n\nTiming is crucial, so it’s advisable\nto practise this manoeuvre with an\nexperienced instructor.\n\nIt’s important, after turning around\nan obstacle, to get the vehicle going\nstraight before you begin a second\nsteering movement.\n\nIf your choice is between braking\nor steering, choose to steer. You\ncan steer around an obstacle in a\nshorter distance than it takes to stop\nin front of it.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.10 Emergency driving\n\n\n\n    Combined braking and steering\n    Where you have a choice, the best method of dealing with an emergency is to\n    combine braking and steering. Brake ﬁrst, while you slow down and regain control\n    and ﬁnish deciding where you want to go.\n\n    If you have time and you are feeling calm, threshold brake. If not, lock your four\n    wheels. Regardless of the method of braking you use, take your foot off the brake to\n    steer around the object. Most importantly, do one thing at a time, either brake or steer.\n    If your wheels are locked, the car will go straight ahead regardless of how you turn the\n    steering wheel.\n\n\n\n\n                     Brake     Off brake      Steer\n\n    If you are driving a vehicle equipped with ABS, the best way to deal with an\n    emergency is to brake hard and steer where you want to go.\n\n\n    Neutral/declutch\n    Providing it’s recommended for your vehicle type, it’s best to shift to neutral, or\n    declutch, in all emergencies, except when you plan to use the accelerator to get\n    out of trouble. Please refer to your vehicle owner’s manual for manufacturer’s\n    recommendations in this regard.\n\n    Skidding\n    A skid usually occurs on a slippery surface when there is not enough traction to\n    keep the tires rolling. You will go into a skid when it is wet or slippery if you brake or\n    accelerate too hard or turn too sharply.\n\n    Regardless of the kind of skid, always shift to neutral (declutch). Turning the wheel in\n    the direction of the skid is correct, but complicated. A much simpler way to decide\n    what way to steer is to look where you want to go and steer there.\n\n    Never use cruise control when roads are wet or slippery or on gravel.\n\n    Skids resulting from braking\n    The remedy is the same in any skid resulting from braking, regardless of how many\n    wheels lock. Shift to neutral (declutch) and remove your foot from the brake. Look where\n    you want to go and steer there. By shifting to neutral, you will ensure that the skid does\n    not get worse and you will get the wheels rolling again so that you can steer.\n\n    You will probably have to correct the steering. Look where you want to go and steer\n    there. This will usually mean steering, counter-steering and straightening out.\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.10 Emergency driving\nSkids resulting from too much acceleration\nSometimes too much acceleration or using cruise control on a slippery surface will\ncause the vehicle to skid. To correct this situation, shift to neutral (declutch), take your\nfoot off the accelerator, look where you want to go and steer there. Do not touch the\nbrake. Some corrective steering may be necessary.\n\nSkids resulting from steering too sharply\nIf you turn the wheel too far to the left or right on a slippery surface, the front wheels\nwill skid straight ahead. To correct this, you must shift to neutral (declutch) and turn the\nwheel back towards the centre. As the wheels move to a position where they are turned\nless sharply, they will begin to grip again and you will be able to steer. You actually turn\nthe wheel in the opposite direction from which you wish to go until the wheels begin to\nroll. Only at this point do you look where you want to go and steer there.\n\n\n\n\nWhen in a skid, look where you want to go and steer there.\n\n\nWhen skids go too far\nSometimes, when a skid has gone too far, the vehicle will start to spin. You may not be\nable to stop the spinning, but you do have a choice of where it spins. Shift to neutral, if\nyou have time, and lock all four wheels. The vehicle will spin in a straight line, continuing\nin the direction in which it was last going. Usually, if you do this you can stay on the road.\n\nTo avoid getting into skids\nTo avoid getting into a skid, ﬁrst adjust your speed to the conditions, then look well\nahead so that you have plenty of time to react slowly and smoothly. If you must make\nany movements on a slippery surface, make them smoothly and gently and avoid\nsudden movements of the steering wheel.\n\nDo not turn a little problem into a tragedy\nMany collisions are caused by the driver’s over-reaction to a possible emergency\nsituation. If you ﬁnd yourself in an emergency situation, try to remain calm and take the\ntime to think before you act. As a skid develops, the earlier you take action, the smaller\nthe corrective movement required and the greater are your chances of controlling it.\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.10 Emergency driving\n\n\n\n    Drifting onto a soft shoulder\n    If you drift onto a soft shoulder, it’s not what you do that is important, it is what you do\n    not do that counts.\n\n    If your right wheels drop onto a soft shoulder, don’t jerk the wheel to get back on the\n    road in a hurry and don’t brake hard.\n\n    Do not take any corrective action immediately, just steer straight along the shoulder,\n    gradually slowing down. Then, when you have slowed and there are no other vehicles\n    around, turn the wheel left and almost immediately (when you feel your front wheel\n    come onto the road) counter-steer and straighten out.\n\n\n\n\n    It’s a simple procedure as long as you don’t steer very much. You should, however,\n    grip the wheel tightly.\n\n    If you come off in a critical location, for example, just before a bridge, then treat your\n    return to the road like an emergency lane change and steer, counter-steer, straighten.\n\n    Ditches\n    With ditches, as with soft shoulders, it’s what you don’t do that’s important.\n\n    Don’t brake hard, don’t turn the wheel violently and don’t try to get back on the road.\n    These actions are very likely to cause your vehicle to roll over.\n\n    The important thing is to drive down the ditch. The greater the slope of the ditch, the\n    more you will have to steer down the ditch to keep from rolling.\n\n    To drive down the ditch, hold the wheel ﬁrmly. Look and steer gently down the slope\n    to where you want to go. Stay off the brake. Gradually release the accelerator. If\n    you need to steer to avoid an obstacle, do it slowly and gradually and, if you have a\n    choice, choose the direction that will send you down the slope.\n\n    If you suddenly ﬁnd yourself going into a ditch, do not over-react. Try to resist doing\n    anything until you think about what you must do. You’re better off to do nothing than\n    to try the wrong thing.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.10 Emergency driving\n\n\n\n\nGentle ditch                                   Steep ditch\n\nIt’s perfectly all right to drive in a ditch to avoid a rollover, provided you don’t hit an\napproach road or something hard. The main cause of rollovers is attempting to return\nto the road too early. You may have to be towed out, but that is a small price to pay\ncompared to rolling the car.\n\nBlow-outs\nWith a front or rear tire blow-out, do not over-react. Look where you want to go and\nsteer there, holding the steering wheel ﬁrmly. Gradually ease off the accelerator and\ngently brake. Once you have slowed down, steer the vehicle off to the side of the\nroad.\n\nBlow-outs can cause tremendous steering and wheel vibration. Do not be alarmed.\nRemember, gentle braking will improve stability and reduce steering and wheel\nvibration.\n\nRear wheel blow-outs can cause the back of the car to ﬁshtail. Do not over-correct\nyour steering. Just brake gently and steer where you want to go. Remember to shift to\nneutral (declutch).\n\nBrake failure\nVehicles are manufactured with a two-circuit hydraulic brake system, and total brake\nfailure is very rare. If one half of the system fails, the brake warning light will usually\ncome on when you apply the brakes and you’ll have to push much harder to slow or\nstop the vehicle. Even if the brake pedal goes right to the ﬂoor, do not give up. It‘ll still\nhave stopping power.\n\nYou can help slow the vehicle by using the parking brake. Try to avoid having the rear\nwheels lock as this will cause the vehicle to spin around. By adjusting the parking\nbrake release, you will make it easier to vary the pressure and avoid locking.\n\nDon’t pump your brakes. It’s the wrong thing to do with a modern brake system. If the\nvehicle pulls to one side, grasp the wheel ﬁrmly, counter-steer and shift to a lower\ngear. After the car has stopped, do not drive any further. Call for help.\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.10 Emergency driving\n\n\n\n    Power steering or power brake failure\n    Most vehicles have some form of power assistance for braking and steering to reduce\n    the force necessary to operate the controls.\n\n    If the engine stalls, you’ll lose your power assistance and will have to apply a great\n    deal more force to the brake or steering wheel to maintain control. Try shifting to\n    neutral and re-starting the engine, then return the shift lever to drive.\n\n    Accelerator sticking\n    If your accelerator sticks, don’t panic. Shift to neutral (or declutch), slow down, pull\n    over and stop. Then, turn the key off and try unsticking the pedal with your feet.\n\n    Headlight failure\n    If your headlights suddenly go out, immediately slow down to keep your original\n    course, pull over and stop. Check the headlight switch and the dimmer switch. If\n    these don’t work, put on the parking lights or hazard lights.\n\n    Animals on the road\n    Peak times\n    Wild animals are unpredictable but there\n    are times when the risk of a collision is\n    particularly high. Be alert during the months\n    of May and June when animals are drawn\n    to ditches for road salt and to escape biting\n    insects. Animals are also especially active\n    in the late fall and early winter during mating\n    season and migration. The peak times for\n    collisions are dawn and dusk.\n\n    Watch your speed\n    Yellow wildlife warning signs indicate areas\n    of high risk. No matter the season or time\n    of day, it’s important to watch for signs of\n    wildlife and reduce your speed accordingly.\n    Slowing down reduces the distance\n    required to stop and decreases the force of\n    impact in the event of a collision.\n\n    Be alert\n    It’s important to constantly scan the road from shoulder to shoulder. Being alert is still\n    your best defence to prevent a collision. When you see an animal at the side of the\n    road, slow down and pass by slowly. For night driving, look for the glowing eyes of\n    animals and use your high beams whenever possible.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.10 Emergency driving\nWhen encountering an animal, try to do the following:\n• Remain calm if an animal appears on the road in front of you. If you have time to\n  stop, do so at a safe distance and stay alert. When one animal crosses the road,\n  others often follow. You can also sound your horn to scare wildlife away from the\n  road.\n• If an animal appears suddenly and surprises you, remember to brake ﬁrmly and stay\n  in control of your vehicle. Avoid swerving because you may turn into oncoming trafﬁc\n  or roll into the ditch.\n• If the animals are being herded or if you approach horseback riders you should slow\n  down and wait for the herder or rider to move the animals across the road or to one\n  side and indicate that it’s safe to proceed. Do not use your horn as it may panic or\n  scatter the animals.\n\nWhen a collision is unavoidable\nSometimes collisions with wildlife are unavoidable even if you take every precaution\nand remain alert at the wheel. In these circumstances, try to remain calm.\n• Aim your vehicle at the spot where the animal came from, not where it’s going.\n• Try for a glancing blow rather than a head-on encounter and let up on your brake just\n  before you collide. This causes the front of your vehicle to rise slightly and reduces\n  the chances of the animal going through your windshield.\n• Hitting an animal can be a traumatic experience. If possible, move to the shoulder\n  and turn on your hazard lights. Take a moment to regain your composure and then\n  assess the damage to your vehicle.\n• Don’t approach the animal, especially if it appears to be wounded. Injured animals\n  can be dangerous.\n• Call the police or your local RCMP detachment if there are human injuries or\n  signiﬁcant damage to your vehicle. If the damage is less severe, you may continue\n  driving and follow regular SGI claims reporting procedures.\n• Call the Conservation Ofﬁcer Service if there is a dead or injured animal to report.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.11 Understanding collisions\n\n\n\n    6.11 Understanding collisions\n    When you know your front steps are icy, you take special care when going down\n    them. By being aware of and understanding some basic trafﬁc collision statistics,\n    you’ll know to take special care to avoid high-risk situations.\n\n    Two-thirds of the time, the causes of collisions are related to driver condition or\n    improper action.\n\n    Some of the most common contributing factors to collisions are:\n    • driver inattention\n    • failing to yield the right of way\n    • driving too fast for road conditions\n    • driving under the inﬂuence of alcohol or drugs\n    • disregarding a trafﬁc control device\n    • driver inexperience or confusion\n    • following too closely\n    • backing unsafely\n    • changing lanes or passing improperly\n\n    Other information you should know about collisions:\n    • Most trafﬁc collisions occur during peak trafﬁc times such as late afternoon and early\n      evening.\n    • November and December usually have the highest total number of collisions.\n    • August and October are when the most severe collisions and the most trafﬁc deaths\n      occur.\n    • Alcohol is a factor in about 4% of all trafﬁc collisions and in about 40% of all fatal\n      collisions.\n    • Approximately 90% of all collisions in rural Saskatchewan are single-vehicle\n      collisions.\n    • Wearing a seatbelt can decrease your chances of being killed or seriously injured in\n      a collision by as much as 50%.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.12 What to do if you are in a collision\n6.12 What to do if you’re in a collision\nThe ﬁrst few minutes after a crash can be critical if the consequences are to be\nminimized. If you haven’t been seriously injured during the collision, the following\nsteps should be followed as quickly and calmly as possible.\n\nProtect the scene\nIf any gasoline has spilled, make sure the ignitions of any damaged vehicles are turned\noff and any cigars or cigarettes are extinguished.\n\nWarn approaching trafﬁc by setting up ﬂares (well away from the crash scene)\nor delegating two people to signal at each end of the collision scene. Turn on the\nhazard lights of all undamaged vehicles at the scene. This is particularly critical during\ndarkness or at times of reduced visibility when the risk of subsequent collisions is very\nhigh.\n\nCheck all injuries\nMake an initial survey of damage, checking for hidden victims. Call 9-1-1 and\nadminister ﬁrst aid to the injured in order of priority. Injured persons should be moved\nonly if they are in danger of drowning, suffocating, burning or being electrocuted.\n\nIf you have not had formal training in ﬁrst aid, follow these tips:\n• If the person is unconscious, be sure their air passages are clear. False teeth,\n  chewing gum, vomit or mucus can block air passages.\n• If the person is not breathing and you’re familiar with mouth-to-mouth or artiﬁcial\n  respiration, begin the procedure immediately.\n• Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure over the wound. A clean piece of tissue\n  or handkerchief may be used. If there is a depressed skull fracture, pressure should\n  not be applied.\n• If a person is pinned in a car, do not attempt to move them, but be sure the head\n  and spine are ﬁrmly supported.\n• Reassure the injured individual and stay with them until an ambulance or other\n  vehicle is available to take them to the hospital.\n• Give all information on the ﬁrst aid that you have applied to the ambulance attendant\n  and the police.\n\nContact the police\nAll crashes involving injury or death, hit and run, an impaired driver, an out-of-province\nvehicle or where a vehicle must be towed from the scene must be immediately\nreported to police.\n\nBe prepared to give an accurate description of the crash location, the number of\ninjured persons, the severity of the injuries and any other support services that may be\nrequired, such as ambulance, ﬁreﬁghting, rescuing or towing. Stay on the phone long\nenough to make certain that all the information has been recorded.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.12 What to do if you are in a collision\n\n\n\n    Check for witnesses\n    Record the names of any witnesses to assist the police with their investigation. Keep\n    a copy of the names for your insurance company or lawyer in case any legal action\n    follows.\n\n    Take photographs\n    Take photographs of the collision scene, vehicles involved in the crash and road\n    conditions.\n\n    When to provide a report to police\n    If asked, you’re required to provide a statement to police if you were a driver,\n    passenger or witness.\n\n    If you’re involved in a collision in which there are no injuries or deaths, that does not\n    involve a hit and run or an impaired driver, that does not involve an out-of-province\n    vehicle and where all vehicles can be driven from the scene of the collision, you must\n    provide the vehicle owner with your name, address, driver’s licence number and any\n    relevant insurance information.\n\n    Dangerous goods\n    If a vehicle involved in the collision is a truck displaying a dangerous goods placard,\n    you must take extra care in case the vehicle is discharging a dangerous substance.\n\n    Power lines\n    If your vehicle comes in contact with a power line, stay in your vehicle and call\n    SaskPower at 306-310-2220. If it’s an emergency, call 9-1-1 and stay in your vehicle\n    until help arrives.\n\n    If your vehicle is on ﬁre and you must exit the vehicle:\n    1. Make sure there are no wires in your way.\n    2. Stand in the doorway of the vehicle with feet together and cross your arms over your\n       chest.\n    3. Jump as far away from the vehicle as possible and land with both feet together.\n    4. Do not touch the vehicle.\n    5. Keep arms crossed, feet together, and hop at least 10 metres to safety.\n\n    If you see a collision involving a power pole, fallen line or transformer:\n    1. Park at least 10 metres away and assess the situation before getting out of your\n        vehicle.\n    2. Don’t touch the other vehicle(s), power pole, fallen line or transformer because they\n        may be energized.\n    3. Call 9-1-1 and provide a detailed description of the scene and the electrical hazard.\n    4. Keep yourself and others at least 10 metres away and wait for emergency personnel\n        to arrive.\n    Visit saskpower.com for more information on vehicle collisions and electrical safety.\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.12 What to do if you are in a collision\nExchange information with other drivers\nAs a driver in Saskatchewan, you’re required to provide your name, address, driver’s\nlicence number and vehicle licence plate number to any other persons involved in a\ncollision, regardless of the severity. You should also record the licence plate number\nof all vehicles involved in the collision. If a non-Saskatchewan vehicle is involved, or if\nyou are involved in a collision outside Saskatchewan, you’re also required to provide\ninformation on the company that insures your vehicle.\n\nDon’t admit fault or any other liability before discussing the details of the collision with\nyour insurance adjuster.\n\nDon’t offer to pay for any repairs or accept payment for repairs unless you’re prepared\nto handle the matter without the help of your insurance company.\n\nReport to SGI\nTo report your claim:\n• Visit www.sgi.sk.ca and use the SGI Auto eClaim registration service.\n• Call the claims centre closest to your home (see the SGI information pages in the\n  front of your SaskTel phone book).\n• Call 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744).\n\nWhen you report a claim, you’ll need to have your vehicle appraised and the damage\nassessed. You can set up an appointment at an SGI claims centre or your adjuster\nmay tell you that you can take your vehicle to an SGI-accredited repair ﬁrm to\ncomplete the assessment. To help you avoid delays, please don’t visit a claims centre\nfor an appraisal without ﬁrst calling the claims centre closest to your home or using\neClaim.\n\nIf your vehicle is not driveable, call the claims centre closest to your home to make\narrangements with an adjuster. Your vehicle will be towed to a location where the\ndamage can be appraised.\n\nTo speed up the process when you report your claim, have the following information\non hand: your driver’s licence, the vehicle registration and, if you have one, your auto\nextension policy number.\n\nCollisions involving injury, death, hit and run, an impaired driver, vehicles that have to be\ntowed from the scene or an out-of-province vehicle must also be reported to the police.\n\nAn appraiser will assess the damage to\nyour vehicle and the cost of repairs.\nOnce the appraisal is done, you will\nreceive a printout outlining the cost of\nrepairs if your vehicle is repairable.\n\nOnce your adjuster has conﬁrmed your\ncoverage, you may have the vehicle\nrepaired at the auto body shop of your\nchoice.

Rather, you tend to stare\nstraight ahead.\n\nWhat can you do about it?\n• Recognize and admit that you’re becoming tired. Some highways have rumble strips\n  along the shoulder line and, in a few places, on the centre lines to alert drivers when\n  they drift out of their lane.\n• Stop and rest.\n• Change drivers when you start to feel tired.\n\nIf you can’t stay awake, then for your safety and the safety of others, get off the road!\n\nPersonal stress and illness\nBy now, it should be clear to you that\ndriving places heavy demands on your\nability to think clearly. Emotional and\nphysical stress – worry, grief, anger, joy,\na toothache, a headache – anything that\nis really bothering you, will distract you\nfrom the thinking part of your driving.\nIf you know you’re under stress, either\nemotional or physical, do not drive.\nArrange to be driven by someone else\nwho is not involved in the emotional\nsituation and who is physically well.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.13 Impairing factors (other than drugs and alcohol)\n\n\n\n    Aggressive driving\n    Slow moving trafﬁc, a motorist who doesn’t signal, a seemingly endless stream of\n    pedestrians – they can all frustrate the average driver. Aggressive driving, more\n    commonly known as road rage, occurs when a motorist becomes angry, hostile or\n    furious behind the wheel. And it’s not only yelling obscenities or running other drivers\n    off the road that are signs of road rage. The slightest variation in driving behaviour, no\n    matter how minimal, is still considered road rage.\n\n    To ensure a safe trip, it’s recommended that drivers:\n    • don’t take trafﬁc problems personally                   • use your horn sparingly\n    • avoid eye contact with an aggressive driver             • don’t block the passing lane\n    • don’t make obscene gestures                             • don’t block the right turn lane\n    • don’t tailgate\n\n    If you notice someone on the road who is driving aggressively, the best thing you can\n    do to ensure your safety is to pull over and let that person pass by you.\n\n    Fog, dust, heavy rain and poor visibility\n    These factors may impair your vision:\n    • Make sure that your headlights and\n      tail lights are on and clean so that\n      other people can see you.\n    • Adjust your speed to the number of\n      seconds you can see ahead. If you\n      can’t see 12 seconds ahead, slow\n      down until you can.\n    • In fog, blowing snow or heavy rain you\n      will see better if you drive with your\n      lights on low beam.\n    • The smear that windshield wipers sometimes create may be removed by using a\n      good windshield wiper ﬂuid or a sprinkle of ordinary detergent.\n    • If you have already slowed down and still cannot see 12 seconds ahead, ﬁnd a safe\n      place as soon as you can and get off the road.\n\n    Be aware that during the ﬁrst 10 minutes of a rain storm, the roads are the most\n    slippery. The solution to driving in heavy rain is to slow down, making only small and\n    gentle movements with your brake, accelerator and steering wheel.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.13 Impairing factors (other than drugs and alcohol)\nCellphones\nMany collisions are the result of driver distraction. Many people talk or text on a\ncellphone while driving, which can have dangerous consequences. As a result, there\nis legislation that prohibits the use of a cellphone without a hands-free headset while\ndriving.\n\nThe following are key tips to remember when using a cellphone in your vehicle to\nensure a safe ride:\n• put your cellphone in a place where it won’t tempt you, such as the back seat, or\n  switch it off or to airplane mode while you drive\n• always use a hands-free unit (experienced drivers only)\n• become familiar with your phone and its features – before you try to use the hands-\n  free unit while driving\n• don’t dial while driving – instead, pull off the road\n• be a good Samaritan by reporting emergencies and road hazards\n• never take notes or look up phone numbers while driving\n• avoid stressful or emotional conversations while on the road; you can always pull\n  over or end the conversation\n• do not use a cellphone when refueling your vehicle\n• most importantly, whenever possible, pull over to a safe spot on the roadside to use\n  the phone\n\nSee Distracted driving page 23.\n\nCigarette smoke\nOpen the windows while smoking.\nVehicles with children in them are\nnon-smoking areas; it’s illegal to smoke\nwhile children are in the vehicle.\n\nCigarette smoke will gradually cause a\nﬁlm on the inside of your windshield and\nwindows. If people who smoke use your\nvehicle, clean the inside of your windows\nwith window cleaner as soon as you\nnotice the start of a build up.\n\n\n\n\n 7     Drinking, drugs and driving\n      7.1 Alcohol\n\n\n\n\n    7. Drinking, drugs and driving\n    7.1      Alcohol\n    Facts about drinking and driving in Saskatchewan:\n    • A drinking driver is involved in four out of every 10 fatal collisions.\n    • There is a drinking driver in approximately 6% of all collisions where someone\n      is injured.\n    • Of the average 34 people killed, 24 were drivers, seven were passengers, two\n      were pedestrians.\n    • Of the average 34 people killed, 19 were killed on highways, six on rural roads,\n      four on urban streets and ﬁve on First Nations roads.\n    • Those aged 25-34 are involved in the most alcohol-related collisions.\n    • Alcohol, although legal, is an addictive drug that depresses the central nervous\n      system (brain) and may change your mood and behaviour.\n     Based on 2018 to 2022 ﬁve-year average.\n\n    The impairing effects of alcohol on the brain\n    Alcohol affects everyone differently. Blood alcohol content (BAC) may be affected\n    by age, gender, physical condition, and amount of food consumed, medication and\n    other factors. Also, different mixed drinks contain different amounts of alcohol, so it’s\n    important to know how much alcohol has been consumed, not just how many drinks\n    the person has had.\n\n    Sequence of effects on the body\n    Alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream very quickly. As blood alcohol levels start to\n    rise, the brain becomes increasingly sedated or drugged.\n\n    1. Judgment                                  2.   Muscle control\n       The ﬁrst part of the body affected             The second part of the body affected\n       by alcohol is the brain, particularly          by alcohol is muscle control. Due to\n       the part of the brain that allows              the small muscles in the eye being\n       you to think clearly and make good             very susceptible to the effects of\n       decisions.

The part of the\n       brain that controls social inhibitions is\n       also affected, causing people to say\n       and do things they normally would\n       not. These effects start with one drink.\n\n    Many people wrongly assess their ability to drive after drinking by observing physical\n    dexterity (staggering, etc.). This is incorrect as the greatest percentage of alcohol-\n    related collisions result from faulty thinking during the identiﬁcation, prediction and\n    decision parts of the driving task and not as a result of poor execution (steering,\n    braking, etc.).\n\n\n Drinking, drugs and driving\n7.1 Alcohol\nThe brain functions that are ﬁrst affected by alcohol consumption are not only\nimportant to our ability to drive safely, but are the same ones required to make rational\ndecisions about not driving after drinking. For this reason, you must make the decision\nto separate your drinking and driving and make the necessary alternate transportation\nplans before you have that ﬁrst drink!\n\nIt doesn’t make sense to drive after drinking.

It can also cause paranoia,\ndrowsiness, distorted perception and a\nsense of disorientation – all of which could\ncause you to lose control at the wheel.\n\nSome experts claim that smoking a cannabis joint has roughly a similar level of\nimpairment on driving ability as drinking four pints of beer. Also, reports show that in\nthe majority of fatal collisions where cannabis has been detected in a driver’s body,\nalcohol has also been detected. Alcohol alone or in combination with cannabis\nincreases impairment, collision rate and collision responsibility (the same can be\napplied to other drugs too).\n\nDepressant drugs\nLike alcohol, other depressant drugs include sedatives\nor tranquillizers (used to treat anxiety, depression and\nsleeping disorders, e.g., valium), antihistamines (often\nused in ﬂu, allergy and hay fever remedies) and painkillers.\nThese drugs slow down your brain and body; they blunt\nalertness and reduce motor coordination. This affects a\nperson’s ability to drive safely in a way similar to alcohol.\nAny drug that causes drowsiness can also affect a\nperson’s ability to drive safely.\n\n\n\n\n 7     Drinking, drugs and driving\n      7.2 Drugs\n\n\n\n    People who drive after using any type of depressant can’t react as quickly when they\n    need to. Their vision is affected, and may be blurred or doubled. Depth perception is\n    altered, making it hard to tell whether other vehicles, pedestrians or objects are close\n    or far away. Their driving is more likely to be careless or reckless – weaving, speeding,\n    driving off the road, and (too often) crashing.\n\n    If the label advises against operating heavy machinery, consider it a warning not to get\n    behind the wheel of a vehicle.\n\n    Stimulants\n    Stimulant drugs, such as caffeine and amphetamines, may increase alertness, but this\n    does not mean they improve driving skills. The tired driver who drinks coffee to stay\n    awake on the road should be aware that the stimulant effect can wear off suddenly,\n    and that the only remedy for fatigue is to pull off the road and sleep. Amphetamines\n    do not seem to affect driving skills when taken at medical doses, but they do make\n    some people over-conﬁdent, which can lead to risky driving. Higher doses of\n    amphetamines often make people hostile and aggressive.\n\n    If you think drug taking has little, or even a positive impact on your driving, you could\n    be tragically mistaken. It’s important to bear in mind that it can be hard to determine\n    exactly how a drug will affect your driving ability – impairment caused by drugs can\n    vary according to the individual, drug type, dosage, the length of time the drug stays\n    in your body, or if the drug has been taken with other drugs or alcohol.\n\n    When taking prescription or over-the-counter medications, it’s wise to consult with\n    your doctor or pharmacist before driving.\n\n\n\n\n Drinking, drugs and driving\n7.2 Drugs\nIllegal drugs\nIllegal drugs impair your driving. They can alter your perception of time and what you\nsee. They can make you hallucinate or miss things you should see. They can put you\nto sleep.\n\nCocaine\nThis is a psycho-stimulant that can lead to misjudging driving speed and stopping\ndistances. It can also cause a distorted sense of light and sound and a feeling of\noverconﬁdence, which can lead to aggressive and erratic driving. While it can make\nyou feel alert at ﬁrst, the effects wear off quickly, leading to an increased danger of\nfalling asleep at the wheel.\n\nEcstasy\nA stimulant drug with hallucinogenic properties, ecstasy can distort your sense of\nvision and heighten your sense of sound. Your concentration can be affected, while\nyou may become over-conﬁdent and more likely to take dangerous risks.\n\nKetamine, LSD and magic mushrooms\nDrugs such as these with hallucinogenic properties can strongly inﬂuence the senses,\nso drivers may react to objects or sounds that aren’t there and place themselves and\nother road users in danger. Coordination skills are likely to be greatly affected, and\nyou may experience anxiety, blurred vision and a sense of detachment from reality – all\nof which could be deadly on the road.\n\nSpeed (amphetamine)\nWhile amphetamines might give you a sense of heightened alertness and conﬁdence,\nthey can be highly dangerous for drivers as they distort your perceptions and can\nmake you feel anxious, prone to panic attacks and lose coordination.\n\nDrug-impaired driving is considered as serious an offence as alcohol-impaired driving,\nand carries the same penalties.\n\nThere are no illegal drugs that improve your driving. They all make it worse. Don’t drive\nafter using any drugs.\n\n\n\n\n 7     Drinking, drugs and driving\n      7.3 Drinking and drugs combined\n\n\n\n    7.3     Drinking and drugs combined\n    Many people think that driver impairment is caused exclusively by ingestion of\n    alcohol. The truth is that the alcohol in one’s body will determine their blood alcohol\n    level. However, if that person already has another drug in their system, the impairing\n    effect on the functioning of the central nervous system (brain) is far greater than the\n    impairing effect of the alcohol and the impairing effect of the other drugs combined;\n    it’s not a simple adding together of impairment, but rather a multiplier effect!\n\n    This is the synergistic effect! What it means is that the whole is greater than the sum\n    of its parts, or 1 + 1 = more than two. When combining drugs and alcohol it causes a\n    multiplying effect. This has an unpredictable effect on driving and can be deadly.\n\n    Perhaps a few real life examples would be helpful to understand this synergistic\n    effect. Assume that a drink is:\n    • 1 bottle of regular alcohol content beer; or\n    • 5 ounces table wine; or\n    • 3 ounces fortiﬁed wine (port or sherry); or\n    • 1-1/2 ounce hard liquor (rye, rum, vodka etc.).\n\n    Combined with:\n    • anti-depressants\n    • gravol\n    • antihistamines\n    • valium\n\n\n\n\n Drinking, drugs and driving\n7.3 Drinking and drugs combined\nWe ﬁnd that there is a predictable synergistic effect related to the level of impairment\ncaused by a certain number of drinks when combined in this manner.\n\n   Number of                                                   Equivalent to Number\n                                  Combined With\n    Drinks                                                           of Drinks\n        2                 Antihistamine (Cold Remedy)              = 4 to 5\n        2                         Marijuana (1 joint)              = 5 to 6\n        2               Tranquilizer (Valium – normal dose)        = Approximately 6\n        2                              Gravol                      = Approximately 6\n\nIt must be noted that the dosage of the drug will have a serious effect on the\n“equivalence to number of drinks” estimates. Hydroponically grown marijuana, for\nexample, is much stronger than the light dosage drug used in compiling the ﬁgures for\nthis chart.\n\nIn all cases, the Intoxilyzer reading would indicate just the blood alcohol level caused\nby two drinks, but the actual impairment of central nervous system function would be\nequivalent to a much higher blood alcohol level.\n\nUnderstanding the synergistic effect of alcohol combined with other drugs could be a\nlifesaver.\n\nStudents Against Drinking and Driving (SADD)\nSADD is a positive lifestyle promotional program that attempts to make drinking and\ndriving socially unacceptable among young people and encourages them to help\neach other change their attitudes about drinking and driving. With the help of an adult\nleader, students develop and promote the program themselves using assemblies,\nrallies, classroom sessions and social activities. Parents are encouraged to support\nthe program by attending SADD functions and entering into a contract with their\nteenager whereby each agrees to always seek safe, sober transportation home.\n\nFor more information, contact SADD at 306-757-5562.\n\n\n\n\n 8     Complying with the law when driving\n      8.1 The Trafﬁc Safety Act\n\n\n\n\n    8. Complying with the law when driving\n    8.1 The Trafﬁc Safety Act\n    Cities, towns and some villages have their own set of ‘rules of the road,’ known as\n    bylaws. These rules are necessary as each urban centre has special driving situations.\n    However, bylaws must complement The Trafﬁc Safety Act, Saskatchewan’s trafﬁc laws.\n\n    Enforcement\n    To permit the police to function effectively, they’ve been given certain powers. You’re\n    required to comply with the requests or demands of the police when they are carrying\n    out their duties.\n\n    Stopping when signalled by police\n    Police can signal you to stop using their red/blue lights, a special stop light, voice\n    commands or hand signals. You must pull over as close to the right-hand edge of the\n    road as possible and stop before entering the next intersection.\n\n    Producing driver’s licence and registration\n    If requested, you must show the police your driver’s licence and vehicle registration. If\n    you don’t have them with you, the police may allow you up to 48 hours to produce them.\n\n    Unsafe vehicles\n    The police may require you to submit your vehicle for a safety inspection. If they ﬁnd\n    that your vehicle is unsafe, they can order you to take it off the road and to not drive it\n    until it has been repaired.\n\n    Vehicle impoundments\n    If a vehicle is being operated in violation of trafﬁc laws, or presents a hazard by being\n    parked within the traveled portion of a roadway, it may be impounded by police under\n    the SGI Vehicle Impoundment Program.\n\n    Impoundments are based on the actions of the driver. Any vehicle can be impounded,\n    including passenger vehicles, trucks and commercial vehicles.\n\n    There are three types of impoundments:\n    1. Impaired driving impoundments - Includes both drug and alcohol impairment.\n    2. Unauthorized driver impoundments - Includes driving while suspended or without\n       a valid driver’s licence. The vehicle will be impounded for 30 days, if it’s the driver’s\n       second occurrence in a two-year period the impound length is 60 days.\n    3. Rules of the road impoundments - Vehicles will be seized when drivers commit\n       certain high-risk offences. These offences contribute to unsafe roads and impact\n       the severity of collisions. Anyone stopped by law enforcement who is being\n       charged with an offence, meeting the criteria outlined in the chart on page 155\n       will have the vehicle they are driving impounded for the following impoundment\n       terms.\n\n\n Complying with the law when driving\n8.1 The Trafﬁc Safety Act\n\n                             Impound reason                                 On each offence\n\n Fail to stop for a peace ofﬁcer                                                  7 days\n\n Stunting                                                                        30 days\n\n Excessive speeding: double the posted speed limit or more                       30 days\n\n Excessive speeding: 50 km/h or more above posted speed limit                    30 days\n\n Race, contest or stunt on a bet or wager                                        30 days\n\n Contest of speed or race with other vehicles                                    30 days\n\n Any Criminal Code offence which constitutes an offence under The Trafﬁc\n                                                                                 30 days\n Safety Act\n\n\n                                                                           2nd and subsequent\n                                                                On each          offences\n                    Impound reason\n                                                                offence    (previous conviction\n                                                                            within 12 months)\n Driving as a learner while unaccompanied                         n/a             3 days\n\n Driving an unregistered vehicle                                  n/a             7 days\n\n Driving without due care or reasonable consideration\n\n Hold, view or manipulate electronic communication device         n/a             7 days\n while driving\n\nThe vehicle will be impounded even if you’re not the owner. All towing and storage\ncosts are the responsibility of the vehicle owner. The owner of the impounded vehicle\nmay recover from a driver, in any manner authorized by law, any amount the owner has\npaid to recover their motor vehicle.\n\nAn application to the Highway Trafﬁc Board can be made to have a vehicle released\nearly from impoundment in certain limited circumstances. If your vehicle was stolen\nat the time of the impoundment, please contact SGI at 1-844-855-2744 with your\npolice ﬁle number as soon as possible.\n\nImpaired driving\nDrivers who are impaired by alcohol, drugs, or a combination of both may be subject\nto severe consequences. Consequences apply even if the driver is not found\ncriminally impaired, but exceeded the provincial limits.\n\nIf a driver is found to have exceeded the provincial limit, the severity of the\nconsequences are determined based on how many administrative suspensions have\nbeen issued in the past 10 years, and whether they are considered a new driver or an\nexperienced driver.\n\nIf a driver is found to be criminally impaired, the consequences are more severe, and\napply to all drivers.\n\n\n\n\n 8     Complying with the law when driving\n      8.1 The Trafﬁc Safety Act\n\n\n\n    New driver roadside administrative licence suspensions\n    New drivers caught with any detectable amount of alcohol or drugs will be suspended\n    at roadside and face other consequences such as vehicle impoundment and\n    mandatory ignition interlock.\n\n    There is zero tolerance for alcohol for new drivers, and zero tolerance for drugs for\n    both new and experienced drivers.\n\n    New drivers are:\n    • 21 years of age and under\n    • Learner (Class 7)\n    • Class 5 Novice 1 and Novice 2\n    • Endorsement 6, M1, or M2 (while operating a motorcycle)\n    • No licence in the last ﬁve years\n    • Out of Country drivers (when equivalent Class cannot be determined)\n    • Restricted or Provisional drivers\n\n    New drivers who receive roadside suspensions and who are transporting passengers\n    under 16 will receive an increased vehicle impoundment length.

If your blood alcohol\n    content (BAC) is over .08 you have committed a Criminal Code offence.\n\n    Impaired\n    Operating a conveyance while your ability to operate is impaired in any degree by\n    alcohol or a drug or by a combination of alcohol and a drug is an offence.\n\n     Deﬁned as a motor vehicle, water vessel, aircraft or railway equipment.\n\n    Exceeds drug\n    It’s an offence to operate a conveyance when you have a blood drug concentration\n    that is equal to or exceeds the blood drug concentration prescribed by federal\n    regulation for that drug.\n\n    Combination alcohol and drug\n    It’s an offence to operate a conveyance if you have a blood alcohol concentration and\n    a blood drug concentration that is equal to or exceeds the blood alcohol and blood\n    drug concentration prescribed by regulation for instances where alcohol and that\n    drug are combined.\n\n    Operation – low blood drug concentration\n    It’s an offence to operate a conveyance if you have a blood drug concentration that\n    is equal to or exceeds the blood drug concentration that is prescribed by federal\n    regulation for that drug and is less than the concentration prescribed for Exceeds Drug.\n\n    Mandatory Alcohol Screening\n    A police ofﬁcer may demand a breath sample from a driver in the absence of having a\n    reasonable suspicion that the driver has consumed alcohol.\n\n    Refusal\n    If a police ofﬁcer suspects you are impaired they may demand that you provide a\n    breath sample or samples of a bodily substance that, in the police ofﬁcer’s opinion,\n\n\n Complying with the law when driving\n8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada\nare necessary to enable a proper analysis by means of an approved screening device\nor approved drug screening equipment. The police ofﬁcer may also demand that you\nimmediately perform physical coordination tests.\n\nKnowing that a demand has been made for a sample, it’s an offence to fail or refuse to\ncomply without reasonable excuse.\n\nRefusing to comply with a demand is an offence.\n\nAdministrative Consequences for Criminal Code Impaired Driving Offences\nAn indeﬁnite licence suspension will be issued to any driver who is charged\nunder the Criminal Code of Canada with an impaired driving related offence. The\nsuspension will remain in effect until the charges are resolved in court. If the offence\nyou are charged with is alcohol-related, you may be eligible to reinstate your driving\nprivileges early by voluntarily installing an alcohol-sensing ignition interlock device\nin your vehicle. The vehicle being operated will also be seized under the Vehicle\nImpoundment program for a minimum of 30 days, to a maximum of 60 days if the\nBAC is .16 or greater, or if the driver failed to comply with a demand.\n\nFurther consequences will be applied if the driver is found guilty of the offence in\ncourt.

If you’re charged and\n    convicted of a criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the penalties are increased.\n\n    Dangerous driving\n    Failing to exercise reasonable care in the operation of a motor vehicle is an offence.\n\n    Failure to stop at scene of collision\n    If you’re involved in a collision with a person, vehicle or cattle in the charge of a\n    person, you must give your name, address, driver’s licence number and insurance\n    information to any other involved people and assist any injured people.\n\n    Drive while disqualiﬁed\n    If you drive while you’re disqualiﬁed, you could face additional charges, vehicle\n    impoundment, and other ﬁnancial consequences. It’s an offence under the Criminal\n    Code to drive while disqualiﬁed.\n\n    Arrest\n    You may be arrested if you:\n    • operate an unregistered vehicle\n    • drive without a driver’s licence\n    • fail to stop when signalled by police\n    • drive without care and attention or without reasonable consideration for others\n    • tamper with a vehicle\n    • fail to provide information when requested by police\n    • commit Criminal Code offences\n\n    You may be arrested if the police have reason to believe you will not appear in court to\n    answer your summons.\n\n    Licence disqualiﬁcations\n    If you’re convicted of any of the offences                    One conviction        1 year\n    discussed in this section, your licence will be               Two convictions       3 years\n    automatically cancelled and you will be disqualiﬁed           Three convictions     5 years\n    from driving. The period of disqualiﬁcation will be\n    based on the number of Criminal Code convictions\n    you have had in the last 10 years.\n    In addition to these automatic provincial disqualiﬁcations, the court may issue an order\n    prohibiting you from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other\n    public place anywhere in Canada for a period of time. You will not be allowed issue of\n    a full unrestricted driver’s licence until the expiration of the longer period, whether it is\n    the automatic disqualiﬁcation or the court order.\n\n\n\n\n Complying with the law when driving\n8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada\nReinstatement of driving privileges\nIf you’re convicted of a criminal offence you may be eligible for early reinstatement of\nyour driving privileges. Options for early reinstatement may include:\n• ignition interlock special restricted driver’s licence\n• special restricted driver’s licence\n\nThese options are issued on the provision that you have a zero tolerance for drugs\nand alcohol while driving. This means no detectable amount of alcohol or drugs in\nyour system.\n\nIgnition interlock special restricted driver’s licence\nThe Ignition Interlock program is a remedial program for drivers who have received\nimpaired driving suspensions or convictions. An ignition interlock device prevents\nyou from operating a vehicle if you have alcohol in your body. A device is installed in\nthe vehicle that is connected to the vehicle’s ignition that checks for the presence\nof alcohol in the driver. The driver must blow into the machine to start the car, and\ncontinue to periodically blow into the device to keep the car in motion. If the device\nsenses alcohol, the car will not start. If while in motion the device senses alcohol the\nhorn will start honking and headlights will ﬂash to draw attention to the vehicle. These\ncannot be stopped until the vehicle is turned off.\n\nThe ignition interlock special restricted licence is mandatory for the following:\n• Your conviction was for impaired driving, driving while equal to or over the legal limit for\n  alcohol or a combination of alcohol and drugs, or for failing to comply with a demand.\n• You received a third roadside suspension within the last 10 years and it’s alcohol-\n  related. (Note: If you received your ﬁrst two roadside licence suspensions as a new\n  driver, those count towards the number of offences as an experienced driver.)\n\nThe ignition interlock special restricted licence is voluntary for the following:\n• You received a second roadside licence suspension as a new driver within the last\n  10 years.\n• You received an indeﬁnite roadside administrative suspension for an alcohol-related\n  Criminal Code offence and you’ve served at least 90 days of your suspension.\n\nThe device must remain in the vehicle until the ignition interlock suspension period\nends. You cannot wait out your suspension period.\n\nEligibility and program duration\nThe Ignition Interlock program is mandatory for certain impaired driving offences, the\nlength of the mandatory term depends on how many prior offences the driver has in\nthe past 10 years, and the type of impaired driving offence.\n\n\n\n\n 8     Complying with the law when driving\n      8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada • 8.3 Trafﬁc tickets\n\n\n\n    You’re not eligible for early reinstatement of your driving privileges by installing an\n    ignition interlock device if you’ve been declared ineligible by a judge, your conviction\n    is not alcohol-related, or because you’ve been convicted under the Criminal Code of\n    Canada for any impaired driving offence causing bodily injury or death.\n\n    Special restricted driver’s licence\n    A restricted driver’s licence limits when and where you can drive. You may be granted\n    a restricted licence if you demonstrate that:\n    • the licence suspension would cause you exceptional hardship\n    • allowing for a restricted licence would not be contrary to public interest\n\n    You’re eligible to apply to the Highway Trafﬁc Board for a special restricted licence if\n    the following applies to you:\n    • Your conviction is non-alcohol/drug related and you have served the entire court-\n      ordered prohibition period and completed the required educational program.\n    • Your conviction is alcohol/drug related and you have completed the required\n      educational program and your mandatory ignition interlock term, and still must serve\n      the provincial suspension.\n    • You paid the $75 reinstatement fee.\n\n\n    8.3 Trafﬁc tickets\n    When the police charge you with a violation, they’ll issue a ticket indicating the\n    offence you committed as well as the date, time and location. The ticket will also\n    indicate where and when you are to appear in court. Some tickets, including those for\n    stunting, racing and driving at excessive speeds, will result in an immediate roadside\n    suspension.\n\n    For some less serious offences, the ticket will indicate the amount of the ﬁne you must\n    pay. If you choose to plead guilty, you may pay your ﬁne voluntarily through the mail or\n    online, if available.\n\n    You must appear in court to enter a not guilty plea. You’ll then have a trial date set.\n    You may want to consult a lawyer before entering a plea.\n\n\n\n\n Complying with the law when driving\n8.4 Driver Improvement Program\n8.4 Driver Improvement Program\nThe Driver Improvement Program monitors the driving records of all Saskatchewan\ndrivers. The program aims to make Saskatchewan roads safer for everyone by\nreducing the incidence of high-risk behaviours by motorists.\n\nImpaired driving is one example of high-risk driving, but many motorists endanger\nthe lives of others through behaviours that frequently cause motor vehicle collisions,\nincluding speeding, running red lights and stunting.\n\nUnder this program, drivers are assigned points every time they are convicted of a\ntrafﬁc offence or have an at-fault collision. Drivers who reach their maximum threshold\nof points are sent a warning letter to advise that tougher sanctions will follow should\ntheir driving record continue to deteriorate.\n\nDrivers who continue their high-risk behaviour face consequences that include ﬁnes,\ndriver’s licence re-testing, driver’s licence suspensions of up to six months and\ncompletion of a driver improvement training program.\n\nFor more information on the Driver Improvement Program, call 1-844-TLK-2SGI\n(1-844-855-2744).\n\n                                 Penalty                             Demerit points\n\n Program information letter                                        9 or more points\n Warning letter                                                    12 or more points\n Defensive Driving Course                                          15 or more points\n Driver Improvement Training                                       18 or more points\n 30-day suspension                                                 21 or more points\n 90-day suspension                                                 24 or more points\n 180-day suspension                                                27 or more points\n Driver Improvement interview and penalty                          30 or more points\n SGI manual review and penalty                                     33 or more points\n\n\n\n\n 8       Complying with the law when driving\n        8.5 Safe Driver Recognition\n\n\n\n    8.5 Safe Driver Recognition\n    The Safe Driver Recognition (SDR) program rewards safe drivers with a discount on\n    their vehicle insurance.\n\n    If you own or lease a vehicle registered in Class LV, PV or F (one ton model or\n    smaller), you may be eligible to receive a discount on your vehicle insurance premium.\n    That discount will apply to every qualifying vehicle you insure.\n\n    On the other hand, the program also ensures drivers who demonstrate risky behaviour\n    pay their share in ﬁnancial penalties -

Each point in the Safety Zone corresponds to a discount on your vehicle plate\ninsurance, to a maximum of 25%.\n\nEven if you don’t own a vehicle, a positive rating in the Safety Zone is beneﬁcial to\nyou. It protects all safe drivers from ﬁnancial penalties if they are involved in future\nincidents.\n\nYou only receive a ﬁnancial penalty for an incident if it causes you to lose enough\npoints to move you to the Penalty Zone on the scale. As long as you remain in the\nSafety Zone, you continue to receive some level of discount.\n\nYou’re eligible for a Safe Driver Recognition discount on your registered motorcycle\nplates, if you get:\n• To the Novice 2 stage of the Motorcycle Graduated Driver Licensing program and\n  take an SGI -approved motorcycle training course, or\n• Your full M Endorsement.\n\n3 discount zones\n• Good Drivers Zone (+1 to +10) - If you’re in the Good Drivers Zone, you have\n  earned enough safety rating points to receive a discount on your basic vehicle\n  insurance. For each year you drive incident-free, you earn a safety rating point that\n  gives you 2% off your basic vehicle insurance.\n• Great Drivers Zone (+11 to +20) - If you’re in the Great Drivers Zone, you have\n  earned enough safety rating points to receive a 20% discount on your basic vehicle\n  insurance, plus you have earned a cushion to shield you from losing some or all of\n  your discount if you cause a collision or get trafﬁc convictions in the future.\n• Safest Drivers Zone (+21 to +25) - If you’re in the Safest Drivers Zone, you have\n  driven incident-free for more than 20 years. You earn an extra 1% discount for each\n  additional year you drive incident-free up to a maximum discount of 25%.\n\nThe Penalty Zone – Financial penalties\nDrivers lose points for unsafe driving - such as being at fault for a collision or certain\ntrafﬁc convictions and roadside suspensions. Driving disqualiﬁcations automatically\nmove drivers to -20 or lower, regardless of where they were on the scale prior.\n\nFinancial penalties are assessed for incidents that result in a safety rating below zero.\n• You’re assessed a ﬁnancial penalty of $50 for each point you move in the Penalty\n  Zone (capped at a maximum penalty of $1,000).\n• The further an incident moves you into the Penalty Zone, the more you pay for that\n  incident. The maximum penalty noted above applies to most incidents, with the\n  exception of certain Criminal Code convictions. The maximum penalty for a Criminal\n  Code conviction is $2,500, which is for offences that result in bodily injury or death.\n\n\n\n\n 8     Complying with the law when driving\n      8.5 Safe Driver Recognition\n\n\n\n    Motorists are assessed the penalty immediately and have 90 days to pay the charge.\n    These penalties are in addition to ﬁnes handed out by law enforcement for trafﬁc\n    convictions.\n\n    Moving out of the Penalty Zone\n    Each year of incident-free driving moves you one point back towards the Safety Zone.\n    As long as you are moving towards the Safety Zone, you don’t pay another ﬁnancial\n    penalty - you pay only your basic vehicle insurance premium. In other words, you don’t\n    pay your way out of the Penalty Zone - you drive your way out of the Penalty Zone\n    through safe driving.\n\n    After three consecutive years of safe driving, drivers still remaining in the Penalty Zone\n    automatically move out of the Penalty Zone and return to neutral (the starting point),\n    and can begin to earn points towards a discount again.\n\n    For further information visit www.sgi.sk.ca or see SGI’s Safe Driver Recognition\n    brochure.\n\n\n\n\n Fuel-efﬁcient driving techniques\n\n\n\n\nFuel-efﬁcient driving techniques\nSafety should be your number one concern every time you get behind the wheel of\na vehicle. The good news is that practising fuel-efﬁcient driving techniques not only\nimproves road safety, it also reduces fuel consumption and cuts exhaust emissions\nthat contribute to climate change and urban smog. Depending on your driving habits\nand how often you drive, these basic techniques and useful tips could save you\nhundreds of dollars a year in fuel and maintenance costs:\n\n• It’s both safer and more fuel efﬁcient to maintain a steady speed on a road.\n  Accelerate smoothly when passing or merging with faster trafﬁc and avoid hard\n  braking. European tests have shown that aggressive driving, including frequent rapid\n  acceleration and hard braking, can increase fuel consumption by approximately\n  40%.\n• Drive at the posted speed limit. Lowering your highway cruising speed from\n  120 km/h to 100 km/h will reduce fuel consumption by up to 20%.\n• Plan your trips to combine errands and to avoid trafﬁc jams, steep hills, road\n  construction, etc. Combining a number of short trips into one longer one allows your\n  engine and drivetrain to reach peak operating temperature, which is not possible on\n  trips of less than 5 km. Avoiding trouble spots shortens your travel time and reduces\n  unnecessary idling.\n• If you are driving a vehicle with a manual transmission, learn how to use it properly\n  for maximum fuel savings. A tachometer can help you shift the transmission at the\n  most fuel-efﬁcient engine speeds (the owner’s manual will indicate these speeds).\n• If you have cruise control, use it for highway driving to maintain a constant speed.\n  The exception is on hilly terrain, where it’s a good idea to allow the vehicle’s speed\n  to drop slightly going uphill and then let gravity help you build up speed again (to a\n  safe level) going down the other side.\n• In summer, minimize your use of air conditioning. Operating an air conditioner in\n  hot weather can increase fuel consumption by more than 20% in city driving.\n  A more fuel-efﬁcient option for staying cool is to open a window. However, at\n  highway speeds, use your car’s ﬂow-through ventilation – open windows and\n  sunroofs increase aerodynamic drag, which makes the engine work harder and\n  consume more fuel. If you must use your vehicle’s air conditioning, avoid running\n  it continuously. Shut it off after the interior is cool or set the controls to a comfort\n  level that allows the system to cycle.\n• Check tire pressure at least once a month when the tires are cold (i.e., the vehicle\n  has been stationary for at least three hours or has not been driven more than 2 km).\n  If you have to drive more than 2 km to add air, check the tires before you leave and\n  then add the amount of air that is missing from this reading. Inﬂate the tires to the\n  recommended pressure, usually indicated on the car door, glove compartment or\n  in the owner’s manual. With proper tire inﬂation, your car will burn less fuel and\n  be safer to drive. A vehicle with tires that are under-inﬂated by a total of 10 psi\n  increases fuel consumption by 5%.\n\n\n\n\n   Fuel-efﬁcient driving techniques\n\n\n\n\n• Use a block heater in the winter to warm the engine oil and make cold starts easier\n  on your engine components. Your vehicle’s oil doesn’t freeze when the temperature\n  dips below 0˚C, but it does get much thicker. This means your engine has to work\n  harder and use more fuel. Use a timer to switch the block heater on two hours\n  before you plan to drive. Proper use of a block heater can improve your vehicle’s\n  overall fuel economy by as much as 10%. Still, don’t leave your block heater on\n  overnight or your energy savings will disappear in a higher electricity bill.\n• Follow the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended operating procedures and\n  maintenance schedule in your owner’s manual. Regular maintenance such as oil and\n  ﬁlter changes will not only prevent early degeneration of your vehicle’s components,\n  it will also keep them operating at their most fuel-efﬁcient level. A clogged air\n  ﬁlter can increase fuel consumption by up to 10%. Regular maintenance will keep\n  your vehicle operating safely, save you money and, at the same time, help the\n  environment.\n• Remote car starters are handy on cold winter mornings, but don’t start your car\n  too soon. In most driving conditions, today’s modern engines need less warm-up\n  time even on cold mornings. Also, allowing your car to idle too long wastes gas and\n  produces unnecessary exhaust emissions.\n• Idling for more than 10 seconds, except in trafﬁc, wastes more fuel than stopping\n  your engine and restarting again. At the end of the day, stopping unnecessary idling\n  will beneﬁt the environment and save you money.\n ",

IPDE deﬁnes the four steps involved.\n\n\nIdentify\nThe ﬁrst step to good driving and avoiding collisions is to identify, well in advance, real\nand potential hazards.\n\nFrom the thousands of objects in your ﬁeld of vision, you must learn to ﬁlter out those\nthat do not provide you with information relevant to the driving task. For instance,\nalthough a red neon sign attached to a restaurant may catch your eye, it’s an\nunnecessary distraction because it’s irrelevant to the driving task. You must search\nfor real or potential hazards (such as trafﬁc lights or children) and give them your\nimmediate attention.\n\nTo use this information the hazard must be spotted in plenty of time. That’s why your\nwindows need to be clear.\n\nPredict\nStep two is to predict what will happen should you encounter a real or potential\nhazard.\n\n\n\n\nReal hazards\nFor a real hazard, such as a red light, stop sign or a stopped vehicle, you simply\npredict whether or not the trafﬁc light will change or the vehicle will remain stopped.\n\nYou usually see real hazards in plenty of time and will have few problems predicting\nwhat will happen. Although you may be scanning the road properly, a vehicle may\nsuddenly stop right in front of you. You will then have to quickly predict what may\nhappen in the next few seconds.\n\nPotential hazard\nEvery vehicle you share the road with is a potential hazard. Be aware of where other\ndrivers could go. Make your best prediction of what they’re likely to do and keep\nrevising this prediction as you move towards them. Pedestrians, cyclists or children on\nthe side of the road are often potential hazards.\n\nPredict the path of potential hazards. The vehicle may make a right turn. The child may\nrun across the road.\n\nThe more often you practise predicting what may happen and what pedestrians and\nother drivers might do, the quicker you’ll be able to make accurate predictions.\n\n\n 5        Basic driving skills\n         5.2 The IPDE method of driving\n\n\n\n    Decide\n    Step three is to decide exactly what you’ll do to drive smoothly and deal with the\n    hazard. This means planning your actions in detail and checking to see that the way is\n    clear to proceed.\n\n    Real hazards\n    You may decide to simply brake gently or change lanes to avoid the hazard, or you\n    may want to brake hard, release the brakes and steer.\n\n    Potential hazards\n    When you encounter a potential hazard, you may decide to take no action and\n    continue to monitor the actions of other drivers, or you may decide to take action to\n    avoid the other vehicles.\n\n    Consider the following steps before you take any action:\n    1.    Check that your chosen gate is still open.\n    2.    Check the surface condition of the roadway for braking.\n    3.    Check the shoulder and the ditch.\n    4.    Continue to watch the vehicle and decide whether you will take action to avoid it.\n\n\n\n\n\n    Executing some of your decisions will simply mean making a smooth stop at a\n    trafﬁc light.\n\n    Executing other decisions may involve using techniques for emergency driving.\n\n    To be good at executing your decisions, particularly emergency decisions, you need\n    to practise in a safe situation, preferably with a trained instructor. Practice helps you\n    overcome the panic that usually arises the ﬁrst time you’re in an emergency.\n",

Continue practising this exercise\n       until you can judge time accurately.\n    The relationship between time and distance varies with speed. Therefore, begin by\n    making all your judgments at the same speed. Then, practise at other speeds at which\n    you most commonly drive, say 100, 80 and 50 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nUsing time to estimate your following distance\nWhen you are driving, estimate the\ndistance between you and the vehicle in\nfront in the following way:\n\n1. Pick something that is on or near the\n   road and is not moving (for example,\n   a sign, pavement patch, shadow or\n   overpass).\n2. When the back bumper of the vehicle\n   ahead is even with the object you have\n   chosen, start counting – “thou - sand\n   one, thou - sand two, thou - sand\n   three,” etc.\n3. When your front bumper is beside the\n   object, stop counting. This will give you\n   the number of seconds between you\n   and the vehicle you are following.\n4. If you are closer than three seconds,\n   drop back and check again until you\n   have achieved a minimum of three-\n   seconds following distance. Any\n   following distance longer than that\n   is safe. However, a longer following\n   distance is recommended when\n   following a motorcycle.\n\nYou will notice that by keeping a three-second following distance, regardless of your\nspeed, the distance between you and the vehicle in front will automatically lengthen\nas you go faster.

This will happen sometimes, but less often than you\n    think. To give up your sight distance, your planning and response time and relaxed\n    driving just because you want to save a few seconds and not let other drivers cut in,\n    is a poor bargain. If you let other drivers dictate your driving style, then you’re not\n    in control.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nThe three-second following distance is recommended when driving conditions are\nideal. If driving conditions are less than ideal, your following distance should increase\naccordingly.\n\nTo understand why, you will need to examine how three seconds would be spent in a\nsituation that could turn into a collision.\n\nFirst, you’ll spend some of the three seconds identifying the problem, predicting the\noutcome and deciding what to do, through the IPDE approach to driving. Then you\nneed some reaction time – to get your foot off the accelerator and apply the brake. If\nyou’re reasonably alert, you can do all of this in three seconds and begin braking, too.\n\nIf you stop at the same rate as the vehicle ahead, you‘ll not hit it.\n\nBut, if the driver in front hits a ﬁxed object; you’re tired and are slower to react than\nthe other driver; the other vehicle has better traction; or, the other driver is more\nskilled at braking than you are, then you need more than three seconds to avoid a\ncollision.\n\nHowever, if you’re looking ahead as far as you should, you’ll see the cause of the\nproblem any time from 12 to 60 seconds ahead – possibly before the driver ahead\nof you sees it. In this case, you can respond to the problem rather than to the brake\nlights of the vehicle in front of you.\n\n\n\n\n     Identify\n\n\n\n\n                     Predict            Decide\n\n\n\n\n                                                           Execute\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n\n\n\n    Of all your senses, your eyesight is the most important for driving.

To help you spot and prevent a\n    potential collision, use the following method.\n\n    Scenario:\n    You’re driving on a road towards an intersection and spot another vehicle approaching\n    the same intersection. You don’t know how fast the other vehicle is travelling or how\n    far away it is from the intersection. To help you determine if a collision is imminent,\n    maintain your speed and course, and turn your head to take note of the other vehicle’s\n    position in relation to you. Continue to maintain your speed and course for a few\n    seconds and check the other vehicle’s position again by turning your head. If the other\n    vehicle is still at the same position, you’re on a collision course. Start slowing down,\n    and be prepared to yield or stop to avoid a collision.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       collision\n\n\n            Slow down here.\n                Be prepared\n             to yield or stop.\n\n\n\n                                                       60°\n\n\n\n\n                                                       60°\n\n\n\n\n    It’s important to turn your head while looking for approaching vehicles and not rely on\n    your peripheral vision only. Peripheral vision is very good at picking out objects that\n    are moving; however, in the above scenario the other vehicle would appear to be not\n    moving as it’s in a ﬁxed position in your peripheral view.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills",

Obey the law and\nincrease your chances of surviving a collision. Put on your seatbelt every time you ride\nin a vehicle. To be most effective, seatbelts must be used properly. First, put the lap\nbelt on, adjusting it to ﬁt over your pelvis, and pull it snug. The lap belt is designed to\ntake the force on your pelvis – not your stomach. Keep the lap portion low.\n\nNext, adjust the shoulder portion of the seatbelt over your chest area. How you do this\nwill vary from vehicle to vehicle. Some adjust automatically, others work like a window\nblind. Adjust your shoulder belt to make it snug, yet comfortable.

If not, the driver\nmay be charged. Passengers aged 16 years and older are responsible for buckling\nthemselves up.\n\nBeing a safety-minded driver means you make sure everyone in your vehicle is\nproperly secured.

These seats belong in the back seat away from air bags. Children will not be\n    protected by a regular seatbelt alone until they are large enough and old enough, which\n    is usually age seven and when they weigh more than 36 kg (80 lb.).\n\n    Car seats or booster seats must be used no matter who is transporting the child,\n    including grandparents, caregivers and if they’re in a taxi or rideshare vehicle.\n\n    For more information on car seats, contact Trafﬁc Safety Community Outreach\n    306-775-6042 or 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744) or email trafﬁcsafety@sgi.sk.ca.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.5 Before you drive\nAirbags\nAlmost all vehicles are equipped with air\nbags.

The force of an airbag deploying is\nenough to critically injure or kill an infant or\nsmall child.\n\n\n\nAirbags are not a replacement for seatbelts. Seatbelts alone provide all the protection\na person needs in low and moderate-speed impacts. Airbags are most effective in\nhigh-speed crashes, where they often prevent serious injury.\n\nDriver-side and passenger-side airbags are common features in newer automobiles.\nAirbags are also installed in the doors of some cars to prevent passengers from\nhitting their heads against the windows or pillars of the car during a collision.\n\nOccupants must wear seatbelts to protect themselves in these circumstances and",

IPDE deﬁnes the four steps involved.\n\n           Identify              Predict           Decide              Execute\n\nIdentify\nThe ﬁrst step to good driving and avoiding collisions is to identify, well in advance, real\nand potential hazards.\n\nFrom the thousands of objects in your ﬁeld of vision, you must learn to ﬁlter out those\nthat do not provide you with information relevant to the driving task. For instance,\nalthough a red neon sign attached to a restaurant may catch your eye, it’s an\nunnecessary distraction because it’s irrelevant to the driving task. You must search\nfor real or potential hazards (such as trafﬁc lights or children) and give them your\nimmediate attention.\n\nTo use this information the hazard must be spotted in plenty of time. That’s why your\nwindows need to be clear.\n\nPredict\nStep two is to predict what will happen should you encounter a real or potential\nhazard.\n\n\n\n\nReal hazards\nFor a real hazard, such as a red light, stop sign or a stopped vehicle, you simply\npredict whether or not the trafﬁc light will change or the vehicle will remain stopped.\n\nYou usually see real hazards in plenty of time and will have few problems predicting\nwhat will happen. Although you may be scanning the road properly, a vehicle may\nsuddenly stop right in front of you. You will then have to quickly predict what may\nhappen in the next few seconds.\n\nPotential hazard\nEvery vehicle you share the road with is a potential hazard. Be aware of where other\ndrivers could go. Make your best prediction of what they’re likely to do and keep\nrevising this prediction as you move towards them. Pedestrians, cyclists or children on\nthe side of the road are often potential hazards.\n\nPredict the path of potential hazards. The vehicle may make a right turn. The child may\nrun across the road.\n\nThe more often you practise predicting what may happen and what pedestrians and\nother drivers might do, the quicker you’ll be able to make accurate predictions.\n\n\n 5        Basic driving skills\n         5.2 The IPDE method of driving\n\n\n\n    Decide\n    Step three is to decide exactly what you’ll do to drive smoothly and deal with the\n    hazard. This means planning your actions in detail and checking to see that the way is\n    clear to proceed.\n\n    Real hazards\n    You may decide to simply brake gently or change lanes to avoid the hazard, or you\n    may want to brake hard, release the brakes and steer.\n\n    Potential hazards\n    When you encounter a potential hazard, you may decide to take no action and\n    continue to monitor the actions of other drivers, or you may decide to take action to\n    avoid the other vehicles.\n\n    Consider the following steps before you take any action:\n    1.    Check that your chosen gate is still open.\n    2.    Check the surface condition of the roadway for braking.\n    3.    Check the shoulder and the ditch.\n    4.    Continue to watch the vehicle and decide whether you will take action to avoid it.\n\n\n\n\n    Execute\n    The ﬁnal step, to execute, means to carry out your decision.\n\n    Executing some of your decisions will simply mean making a smooth stop at a\n    trafﬁc light.\n\n    Executing other decisions may involve using techniques for emergency driving.\n\n    To be good at executing your decisions, particularly emergency decisions, you need\n    to practise in a safe situation, preferably with a trained instructor. Practice helps you\n    overcome the panic that usually arises the ﬁrst time you’re in an emergency.\n\n    Practice makes perfect\n    When you begin practising the IPDE method you’ll be slow and will probably think in\n    words. As you practise, you’ll become faster and begin to think in ideas and pictures.\n    At this stage, you will be able to carry out the entire procedure rapidly. You can cut\n    your reaction time by taking the time to practise the IPDE method. It may save your\n    life.\n\n    Once you have been using IPDE for some time, much of your identifying, predicting,\n    deciding and executing will be carried out instinctively.\n\n    You’ll need to use IPDE more often in heavier trafﬁc and when you are driving at\n    higher speeds.\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.2 The IPDE method of driving • 5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nYou’ll ﬁnd that your physical condition greatly affects your ability to handle IPDE. If\nyou’re tired or ill, you should reduce the IPDE load by travelling at reduced speeds.\nYou can reduce the IPDE load by avoiding heavy trafﬁc. You might also consider not\ndriving.\n\nAlcohol and other drugs make it very difﬁcult to carry out the IPDE process. Since\nIPDE is designed to prevent you from having collisions, it’s not surprising that a large\nnumber of crashes are alcohol-and drug-related.\n\n\n5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nIt’s difﬁcult to judge how far things are ahead of you. It’s even more difﬁcult when\nboth your vehicle and the object outside the vehicle are moving. For example, can you\njudge how far away an approaching car is?\n\nWe all have internal clocks. We all have an internal awareness of time. Why not use\ntime to measure how far ahead things are in day-to-day driving? You can do this by\ncounting seconds.\n\nTo count time in seconds, say out loud, “thou - sand one, thou - sand two, thou -\nsand three,” at a normal speaking rate without pausing between the numbers. This will\ngive you a reasonably accurate count of three seconds.\n\nPractise checking against your watch; you’ll be counting off perfect seconds in\nno time.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.3 Time – the key to judgment\n\n\n\n    The language of time\n    The most important skill in driving is being able to use your eyes effectively to seek\n    out the information you need to drive. To use time as the basis for all of your driving,\n    with special emphasis on your eye use, you need to understand the different ways of\n    estimating time.\n\n    First, you must be able to estimate, while you are driving, how far stationary objects or\n    ﬁxed distances are from you. For example, the sign is nine seconds away and at 100\n    km/h the spaces on the broken lines on the highway disappear about 12 seconds\n    ahead.\n\n    Estimate distance ahead in the\n    following way:\n    1. Pick a stationary object that is on or\n       near the road (for example: a sign,\n       shadow, overpass or pavement\n       patch).\n    2. Guess how many seconds the\n       object is ahead.\n    3. Then start counting “thou - sand\n       one, thou - sand two, thou - sand\n       three,” etc.\n    4. When your front bumper is beside\n       the object, stop counting. This will\n       give you the number of seconds\n       between you and the object chosen.\n       If you guessed 15 seconds and\n       the distance ahead is really eight\n       seconds, then guess a lower number\n       next time. Try for longer distance;\n       see if you can guess how far away\n       40 seconds is. This way you’ll\n       improve your judgment.\n    5. Continue practising this exercise\n       until you can judge time accurately.\n    The relationship between time and distance varies with speed. Therefore, begin by\n    making all your judgments at the same speed. Then, practise at other speeds at which\n    you most commonly drive, say 100, 80 and 50 km/h.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nUsing time to estimate your following distance\nWhen you are driving, estimate the\ndistance between you and the vehicle in\nfront in the following way:\n\n1. Pick something that is on or near the\n   road and is not moving (for example,\n   a sign, pavement patch, shadow or\n   overpass).\n2. When the back bumper of the vehicle\n   ahead is even with the object you have\n   chosen, start counting – “thou - sand\n   one, thou - sand two, thou - sand\n   three,” etc.\n3. When your front bumper is beside the\n   object, stop counting. This will give you\n   the number of seconds between you\n   and the vehicle you are following.\n4. If you are closer than three seconds,\n   drop back and check again until you\n   have achieved a minimum of three-\n   seconds following distance. Any\n   following distance longer than that\n   is safe. However, a longer following\n   distance is recommended when\n   following a motorcycle.\n\nYou will notice that by keeping a three-second following distance, regardless of your\nspeed, the distance between you and the vehicle in front will automatically lengthen\nas you go faster. So, for a three-second following distance at 100 km/h, you will be\ntwice as far back as you would be at 50 km/h and four times as far back as you would\nbe at 25 km/h.\n\nTime – distance relationships\n          Speed                                       3-Second            12-Second\n                            Metres/second        Following Distance   Following Distance\n   km/h         MPH                                  (in metres)          (in metres)\n    100           62             28                     84                   336\n     90           56             25                     75                   300\n     80           50             22                     66                   264\n     70           43             19                     57                   228\n     60           37             17                     51                   204\n     50           31             14                     42                   168\n     40           25             11                     33                   132\n\n\n\n\n 5    Basic driving skills\n     5.3 Time – the key to judgment\n\n\n\n    For a three-second following distance at 100 km/h, you will be twice as far back as\n    you would be at 50 km/h.\n\n                      100 km/h                          50 km/h\n\n\n    There is one situation where a three-second following distance is not enough. If you\n    are following a large truck or van that blocks your view of trafﬁc ahead, drop back to\n    more than three seconds until you can see around the vehicle.\n\n\n\n\n        Incorrect\n\n\n\n\n        Correct\n\n    You may feel that if you try to keep a three-second following distance, other drivers\n    will cut into the space you leave. This will happen sometimes, but less often than you\n    think. To give up your sight distance, your planning and response time and relaxed\n    driving just because you want to save a few seconds and not let other drivers cut in,\n    is a poor bargain. If you let other drivers dictate your driving style, then you’re not\n    in control.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.3 Time – the key to judgment\nThe three-second following distance is recommended when driving conditions are\nideal. If driving conditions are less than ideal, your following distance should increase\naccordingly.\n\nTo understand why, you will need to examine how three seconds would be spent in a\nsituation that could turn into a collision.\n\nFirst, you’ll spend some of the three seconds identifying the problem, predicting the\noutcome and deciding what to do, through the IPDE approach to driving. Then you\nneed some reaction time – to get your foot off the accelerator and apply the brake. If\nyou’re reasonably alert, you can do all of this in three seconds and begin braking, too.\n\nIf you stop at the same rate as the vehicle ahead, you‘ll not hit it.\n\nBut, if the driver in front hits a ﬁxed object; you’re tired and are slower to react than\nthe other driver; the other vehicle has better traction; or, the other driver is more\nskilled at braking than you are, then you need more than three seconds to avoid a\ncollision.\n\nHowever, if you’re looking ahead as far as you should, you’ll see the cause of the\nproblem any time from 12 to 60 seconds ahead – possibly before the driver ahead\nof you sees it. In this case, you can respond to the problem rather than to the brake\nlights of the vehicle in front of you.\n\n\n\n\n     Identify\n\n\n\n\n                     Predict            Decide\n\n\n\n\n                                                           Execute\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.4 Eye use\n\n\n\n    5.4 Eye use\n    Of all your senses, your eyesight is the most important for driving. Your eyes pick up\n    most of the information you need to drive.\n\n    Steer where you look\n    It’s important to understand that your eyes determine the path your vehicle follows\n    – you steer where you look.\n\n    To illustrate this, pick a straight stretch\n    of paved highway with light trafﬁc.\n    While driving, look at the centre line\n    about 12 seconds ahead. Keep looking\n    at the centre line 12 seconds ahead.\n    Observe how the car moves toward the\n    centre line.\n\n    Now, look at the edge of the road\n    12 seconds ahead.\n\n    You will steer where you look.\n\n    To steer straight ahead, look about\n    12 seconds directly ahead of where\n    you are sitting.\n\n    To steer around a curve, look at the\n    inside of the curve to where the centre\n    lines vanish. Do not look in the mirrors,\n    don’t look down at your instrument\n    panel. If you take your eyes off the road,\n    you will not maintain precise control\n    over your steering.\n\n    Remember, if you look at the side of the\n    road, you’ll steer to the side of the road.\n    Look where you want to go, particularly\n    in an emergency or a skid, and steer\n    there.\n\n    Check your mirrors and speed when\n    you’re driving in a straight line, and\n    when steering is less critical.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.4 Eye use\nSearch patterns on highways and rural roads\nWhen you drive on a highway, you hope the road is clear and unobstructed. To verify\nthat, you’ll need to perform a search pattern – searching the road for any obstructions\nor hazards.\n\nLooking up on highways\nAs part of your search pattern, look up as far as you can see. To look up means to\nlook as far ahead as you can see the highway – to the horizon (on a straight road, you\nmay be able to see up to 90 seconds ahead).\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.4 Eye use\n\n\n\n    On a curve, look up across and around as far ahead as you can see. At ﬁrst, you’ll\n    likely have to concentrate to look this far ahead in curves.\n\n    When curving right, look at the shoulder line to the point where it disappears. Keep\n    looking at that point and maintain a steady speed. When curving left, look at the\n    centre line as far as you can see it. When coming out of the curve, look at your lane all\n    the way to the horizon.\n\n    As you develop that “far ahead” view, you’ll automatically drive the curve smoothly and\n    accurately. You’ll also beneﬁt from seeing your path far enough ahead to deal with any\n    obstacles in your path.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.4 Eye use\nReferencing down on highways\nReference down by moving your eyes down from the look up position so that you see\nthe road 12 seconds ahead at 100 km/h.\n\nLook on the road in front of you to where the spaces on the broken lines on the road\ndisappear. This will be about 12 seconds away. This will help you obtain information\nyou require to steer accurately and safely.\n\nUntil now, you have been looking up (to the horizon), referencing down (12 seconds\nahead), looking up, referencing down, etc.\n\nWhen most people try this exercise, they usually ﬁnd that they have not been looking\nup as far as they can see. Also, they have usually been referencing down much closer\nthan 12 seconds.\n\nTo establish search patterns of up to 90 seconds ahead and to stretch your\nreferencing down to 12 seconds requires two things. First, most drivers must admit\nthat they haven’t been looking far enough ahead. Second, you have to practise to\nmake looking up and referencing down a habit.\n\nAs you establish the habit of looking up and referencing down, you’ll see the beneﬁts\nto your driving, and this method will become easier every day. Also, steering where\nyou look will help you overcome steering problems such as wandering within a lane or\nwandering from lane to lane.\n\n\n\n\nSweeping highways with your eyes\nThe next part of your search pattern is to look for things that will interfere with your\npath – vehicles entering from the side, animals or people on the side of the road, or\napproach roads. This involves sweeping your eyes across and to the side of the road.\nTry to sweep about 12 seconds ahead.\n\nFilling in the gap on highways\nNow ﬁll in the gap between you and where you reference down 12 seconds ahead.\nCheck the vehicles in front, the road surface for ice or pot holes, and the width and\nﬁrmness of the shoulders.\n\nChecking your gates on highways\nNext, you need to check which gates are still open; that is, the space around your\nvehicle on all four sides. Pay close attention if you have detected a real or potential\nhazard. Check your mirrors often to see whether the rear and two side gates are\nopen.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.4 Eye use\n\n\n\n    Checking your instruments on highways\n    You should check your instruments when it’s safe to take your eyes off the road. Even\n    checking your speed takes one and a half seconds. Therefore, check your instruments\n    when you’re on a straight stretch of road with your gates open and with no real or\n    potential hazards ahead.\n\n    Check your speed and, less often, glance at your gas gauge and other instruments or\n    warning lights.\n\n\n\n\n    Now your pattern should be: look up, reference down, look up, reference down,\n    sweep left, sweep right, look up, reference down, ﬁll in the gap, look up, reference\n    down, check your gates, look up, reference down, check instruments, etc.\n\n    The exact sequence that you use will vary with the features and the trafﬁc on the\n    highway. The most important part of the sequence is to look up and reference down.\n    Include the others as needed. The more often the situation changes around you, the\n    more often you have to search.\n\n    Search patterns in urban areas\n    The pattern for city driving is similar to that of highway driving. It‘s not easy to achieve,\n    but is worth practising.\n\n    Looking up in urban areas\n    To look up in an urban area, look ahead as far as you can see – usually several\n    trafﬁc lights or a number of blocks ahead. This will give you information about the\n    ﬂow of trafﬁc, the sequence of the lights and whether there is construction or major\n    obstructions ahead.\n\n    Referencing down in urban areas\n    Next in the sequence, you should reference down. To reference down in an urban\n    area, move your eyes down from the look up position so that you view the road 12\n    seconds ahead at city speeds. Even if you cannot see clearly for that distance, you\n    should look around or through the windows of the vehicles ahead. Try to see cars well\n    ahead that are slowing down, changing lanes, turning or stopping. Watch for brake\n    and signal lights.\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.4 Eye use\nSweeping with your eyes in urban areas\nIn the city you need to sweep further to each side and sweep more frequently than\nyou do on the highway.\n\nThe sequence now should be: look up, reference down, look up, reference down,\nsweep left, sweep right, look up, reference down, etc.\n\nFilling in the gap in urban areas\nYou need to ﬁll in the gap between you and where you reference down, 12 seconds\nahead. In the city, you need to do this more often than on the highway because you\ndo not have as clear a view ahead.\n\nChecking your gates in urban areas\nYou need to be more aware of the status of your gates when driving in the city\nbecause vehicles are more likely to be in your blind spot.\n\nNever permit yourself to drive in a situation where there are fewer than two gates\nopen. If you cannot control the rear and side gates, at least you can drop back and\ndouble the distance between you and the vehicle ahead – to ﬁve or six seconds.\n\nChecking your instruments in urban areas\nYou’ll have little time to check your instruments when driving in the city. From time\nto time, check your speed. But remember to do this in light trafﬁc or on straight,\nunobstructed roads. You can check your gauges at trafﬁc lights and stop signs.\n\nSearch patterns at night\nAt night, your search pattern is much the same as it is during the day. You should look\nup and reference down to about 12 seconds ahead. This means that most of the time\nyou’ll be looking beyond the part of the road illuminated by your lights.\n\nYou still need to sweep with your eyes, ﬁll in the gap and check your gates and\ninstruments.\n\nDo not look at the side of the road because you will steer there. Obviously, don’t look\nat oncoming headlights because the glare will blind you. Look 12 seconds ahead,\ndirectly in line with where you are sitting.\n\nSearch patterns in emergencies\nThe rule for where to look in emergencies is simple: look where you want to go and\nsteer there.\n\nIf you are sliding or skidding sideways, don’t look down, don’t look at the instrument\npanel and don’t look at what you might hit. Look where you want to go.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.4 Eye use\n\n\n\n    Preventing potential collisions\n    Most collisions occur at intersections and cross roads. To help you spot and prevent a\n    potential collision, use the following method.\n\n    Scenario:\n    You’re driving on a road towards an intersection and spot another vehicle approaching\n    the same intersection. You don’t know how fast the other vehicle is travelling or how\n    far away it is from the intersection. To help you determine if a collision is imminent,\n    maintain your speed and course, and turn your head to take note of the other vehicle’s\n    position in relation to you. Continue to maintain your speed and course for a few\n    seconds and check the other vehicle’s position again by turning your head. If the other\n    vehicle is still at the same position, you’re on a collision course. Start slowing down,\n    and be prepared to yield or stop to avoid a collision.\n\n\n\n\n                                                       collision\n\n\n            Slow down here.\n                Be prepared\n             to yield or stop.\n\n\n\n                                                       60°\n\n\n\n\n                                                       60°\n\n\n\n\n    It’s important to turn your head while looking for approaching vehicles and not rely on\n    your peripheral vision only. Peripheral vision is very good at picking out objects that\n    are moving; however, in the above scenario the other vehicle would appear to be not\n    moving as it’s in a ﬁxed position in your peripheral view.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.4 Eye use • 5.5 Before you drive\nDriving in dense trafﬁc\nIf you’re not accustomed to driving in\ndense trafﬁc, the experience can be\nhighly stressful. You can make it easier\nif you plan where you wish to go in\nadvance. It’s nerve wracking to drive in a\nnew environment and to try to navigate\nat the same time.\n\nThe most important thing to remember\nis don’t give up your following distance.\nDon’t stop your search pattern. If the\ndrivers around you are driving one\nsecond apart, let them, but don’t be\ntempted to follow their example.\n\n5.5 Before you drive\nVehicle familiarization\nMany drivers have collisions during their ﬁrst week of owning a new car because they\ndon’t know where the controls are.\n\nWhenever you get into a vehicle that is new to you, take time to ﬁnd out where the\ncontrols are. You must be able to operate the windshield wipers, windshield washers,\nhorn, lights, heater, radio, turn signals and hazard lights without looking at them.

New vehicles have new design features that you should be\nfamiliar with if you’re to drive safely and get maximum enjoyment and efﬁciency from\nyour vehicle’s equipment. Visit mycardoeswhat.org to learn more about how to use\nsafety technology and features such as back-up cameras, lane departure alerts, and\nblind spot detection.\n\nBefore you drive check that:\n• doors are properly closed (if security is an issue, you may want to lock your doors)\n• all loose objects are secured\n• your seat is properly adjusted\n• head restraints are properly adjusted\n• mirrors are properly adjusted\n• air ﬂow regulators are adjusted (vents, heaters, air conditioning)\n• seatbelts are fastened and properly adjusted\n• bulbs in warning lights are working and the lights go out when the engine starts (see\n  owner’s manual)\n\nShould an engine or oil warning light come on while operating your vehicle, the cause\nshould be determined as soon as safely possible.

The protection\n    afforded is well worth the effort.\n\n    Adjust the pad of the restraint to support the back of your head. The top of your head\n    restraint should never be lower than the top of your head.\n\n\n\n\n         Incorrect                                     Correct\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.5 Before you drive\nSeatbelts\nA safe passenger compartment is an important part of vehicle design. The front and\nrear of a car are designed to collapse on impact while the passenger compartment\nremains undisturbed. Your chances of survival are, therefore, greatly increased if you\nremain in the passenger compartment.\n\nYour seatbelt will keep you in your seat and will reduce the forces your body\nexperiences in a crash.\n\nIn Saskatchewan, every vehicle occupant must wear a seatbelt where they are\nprovided in a properly adjusted and securely fastened manner. Obey the law and\nincrease your chances of surviving a collision. Put on your seatbelt every time you ride\nin a vehicle. To be most effective, seatbelts must be used properly. First, put the lap\nbelt on, adjusting it to ﬁt over your pelvis, and pull it snug. The lap belt is designed to\ntake the force on your pelvis – not your stomach. Keep the lap portion low.\n\nNext, adjust the shoulder portion of the seatbelt over your chest area. How you do this\nwill vary from vehicle to vehicle. Some adjust automatically, others work like a window\nblind. Adjust your shoulder belt to make it snug, yet comfortable. Shoulder belts\nshould never be worn behind your back or under your arm.\n\n\n\n\nLap belt                                      Shoulder belt\n\nDrivers are legally responsible to ensure that passengers under 16 years of age use\nseatbelts where available and child safety seats, when appropriate. If not, the driver\nmay be charged. Passengers aged 16 years and older are responsible for buckling\nthemselves up.\n\nBeing a safety-minded driver means you make sure everyone in your vehicle is\nproperly secured. Without a seatbelt or proper child safety seat a passenger can\nbecome a dangerous ﬂying object during a collision.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.5 Before you drive\n\n\n\n    Car seats and booster seats\n    In Saskatchewan, children under seven years old must be properly ﬁtted into correctly\n    installed and approved car seats or booster seats for their size, weight, height and age.\n    This is to make sure their smaller bodies are kept safe and not seriously injured in a\n    collision. These seats belong in the back seat away from air bags. Children will not be\n    protected by a regular seatbelt alone until they are large enough and old enough, which\n    is usually age seven and when they weigh more than 36 kg (80 lb.).\n\n    Car seats or booster seats must be used no matter who is transporting the child,\n    including grandparents, caregivers and if they’re in a taxi or rideshare vehicle.\n\n    For more information on car seats, contact Trafﬁc Safety Community Outreach\n    306-775-6042 or 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744) or email trafﬁcsafety@sgi.sk.ca.\n\n\n\n\n Basic driving skills\n5.5 Before you drive\nAirbags\nAlmost all vehicles are equipped with air\nbags. The tough fabric bags inﬂate in crashes\nover 16 km/h, cushioning an occupant’s neck,\nhead and chest in moderate to severe impact.\n\nChildren should never be put in the front\nseat of cars equipped with passenger-side\nairbags. The force of an airbag deploying is\nenough to critically injure or kill an infant or\nsmall child.\n\n\n\nAirbags are not a replacement for seatbelts. Seatbelts alone provide all the protection\na person needs in low and moderate-speed impacts. Airbags are most effective in\nhigh-speed crashes, where they often prevent serious injury.\n\nDriver-side and passenger-side airbags are common features in newer automobiles.\nAirbags are also installed in the doors of some cars to prevent passengers from\nhitting their heads against the windows or pillars of the car during a collision.\n\nOccupants must wear seatbelts to protect themselves in these circumstances and\nto ensure that in the event of a frontal crash, they remain in the seating position\nnecessary for airbags to be effective.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n      5.5 Before you drive\n\n\n\n    Seating position\n    If you don’t sit properly, you cannot steer well nor can you use your brake or\n    accelerator efﬁciently.\n\n    The proper way to sit:\n\n\n\n\n    1.

The following page outlines an\nexcellent method to adjust your vehicle’s mirrors to maximize your view of the road.\nRemember, always adjust your mirrors before you start to drive.\n\nBegin with the rear-view mirror. Adjust the mirror so that you’re able to see as much of\nthe rear window as possible. While adjusting the mirror, aim to keep your head in the\nsame position as it will be when you are actually driving your vehicle.\n\nAdjusting your side mirror is a little more difﬁcult. First, lean to the left so that your\nforehead is barely touching the side window. Then move the mirror so you can just\nsee the left side of your vehicle.\n\nTo adjust the right side mirror, position your head toward the centre of your vehicle.\nAdjust the mirror so it shows just a sliver of the right side of your vehicle.\n\n\n\n\nBy setting mirrors so the driver can see both sides of the vehicle from the driving\nposition, the same image will appear in all three mirrors. By setting them so the driver\nhas to lean to see the sides of the car, the outside mirrors continue on where the\ninside mirror leaves off – signiﬁcantly reducing the blind spot.\n\nAnother advantage of positioning your mirrors this way is that it reduces headlight\nglare from vehicles travelling behind you.\n\nLeft foot brace\nThe left foot brace refers to the bracing of your\nleft foot against the ﬁre wall (located below and\nbehind the pedals separating the engine from the\ndriving compartment) to support you and to keep\nyou ﬁrmly in your seat.\n\nPlace your left foot against the ﬁre wall and\npush whenever you need stability such as\nwhen negotiating a curve, when braking, in an\nemergency or on slippery pavement.\n\n\n\n\n 5     Basic driving skills\n\n\n\n    Bracing with your left foot helps you steer easily and well because you are not leaning\n    on the wheel. Also, if you’re not supporting your weight on the heel of your right foot,\n    it is free to brake and accelerate with greater precision and control.\n\n    The fact that you need a left foot brace for controlled driving means you cannot use\n    your left foot to brake. Always brake with your right foot.\n\n",

It’s used in situations\n       where both straight line backing and sharp turning\n       are required. This method allows you to turn the\n       wheel sharply while ensuring that your front wheels\n       will be straight when your hand is at 12 o’clock.\n       Put your left hand at the 12 o’clock position but\n       do not grasp the wheel. Instead, push your palm\n       against the rim of the wheel with enough pressure\n       so that when you move your hand down and\n       around, the wheel turns, but your palm stays on\n       the same place on the wheel rim.\n\n\n\n",

In the case of back-up\n    cameras, the sun can interfere with the view as can snow, or dirt. Before reversing,\n    look over your shoulder and use your mirrors to check behind you.

Don’t rely primarily on the monitor when backing.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.1 Parking\nAngle parking\nWhere a parking space is at 90 degrees (a right angle) to the road, as it is in most\nparking lots, it’s recommended that you back into the space, unless prohibited. You\nhave the advantage of being able to back in accurately because your windows are\nclear and you are warmed up for driving. In addition, the front end swing occurs in the\naisle, not between two parked cars and you’re backing into a space you know is free\nof obstacles instead of backing into trafﬁc. More importantly, when you drive out you\nwill have an excellent view.\n\n\n\n\nSome parking spaces are at about a 60 degree angle to the road. These spaces are\nusually located in small urban centres and on one-way streets. You’re meant to drive\ninto and back out of them.\n\n\n\n\nSteps in angle parking:\n1. Signal your intention to park and slow down.\n2. Check for approaching trafﬁc from the front and rear.\n3. Approach the stall approximately one vehicle width from the parked vehicles.\n4. When your vehicle’s front end is even with the rear of the stall you want to park in,\n    begin steering sharply to the right while slowly driving towards the centre of the\n    stall. Remember, as you’re turning into the stall, to check that you will not hit the\n    vehicle on either side of the stall.\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n\n\n\n    5. Once your vehicle is centred in the stall, straighten your wheels and continue driving\n        forward until you are completely in the parking stall. Although it’s easy to park,\n        backing out from this position can be hazardous. Shoulder check both your sides\n        and rear — don’t just rely on your rearview mirror. Make sure it’s clear behind and\n        on both sides before backing up. If your vision is blocked, for example, by a truck\n        parked beside you, move back cautiously and watch for pedestrians or vehicles\n        that you may not have seen.\n\n    Parking on a hill\n    The trick to parking on a hill is to turn your front wheels so that if the vehicle rolls\n    away, it will roll into the curb and stop. If there is no curb, the vehicle should roll off\n    the road, not into the path of other vehicles. This will prevent the vehicle from building\n    momentum and will stop it from entering the street. The emergency brake should be\n    applied whenever parking on a slope.\n\n\n\n\n      Downhill with curb          Uphill with curb         Downhill no curb   Uphill no curb\n\n",

You can practise passing safely and once you can judge time\nwell, you have a good method of judging when it’s safe to pass.\n\nYou can get all the information you need to make a passing judgment from two\nestimates: the estimate of your safe passing time and the estimate of the closing time\nbetween you and the approaching vehicle.\n\nThe ﬁrst step in developing your new technique is to ﬁnd out how long it normally\ntakes you to pass. This varies from 10 to 40 seconds depending on your vehicle, your\ntechnique and the difference in speed between you and the vehicle you are passing.\nTo ﬁnd your safe passing time, choose a divided highway or a two-way highway at a\ntime and place when trafﬁc is light.\n\nFirst, determine your passing time as follows:\n1. Follow the vehicle ahead at the same speed, but three seconds back. Note its speed.\n2. Check that you can see at least 40 seconds ahead, that there are no vehicles\n   coming the other way and that there are no intersections or solid lane markings.\n3. Begin counting “Thou - sand one, Thou - sand two” from the point you decide to\n   pass and begin to accelerate.\n4. Signal, and at a point where you still have good vision and can smoothly change\n   lanes around the vehicle ahead, move into the left lane.\n5. Continue in the left lane until you see the vehicle you have just passed in your\n   inside mirror. As you pull back into your original lane, signal right and continue your\n   acceleration. Do not decelerate as you change lanes.\n6. Continue counting until you have completed your pass. Stop your count when your\n   left rear wheel crosses the lane line (just as you are returning to your original lane in\n   front of the vehicle you have passed).\n7. The last number you say after “Thou - sand” is your measure of passing time in seconds.\n\nNext, build in a safety margin that you are comfortable with.\n\nFive seconds is a minimum safety margin. For example, if your passing time is 15\nseconds, add another ﬁve seconds for possible error. This will give you a cushion of\nﬁve seconds if the vehicle coming towards you is approaching faster than normal or if\nyour estimation is not accurate.\n\n\n\n\n   Start counting                     Safe passing time                      Stop counting\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.4 Passing\n\n\n\n    Your passing time + your safety margin = your safe passing time\n    Your safe passing time in this case is 20 seconds.\n\n    If you think about it, your safe passing time will also tell you the minimum sight\n    distance needed for safe passing, even if there is nothing coming the other way.\n\n    Try this several times at highway speeds varying the difference between you and the\n    vehicle ahead until you get a handle on what your safe passing time actually is.\n",

If this occurs\non ice, your stopping distance changes. In most situations, locking four wheels by\npushing hard on the brakes will give you the shortest stopping distance. But on ice,\nespecially when it’s near the freezing point or if you are driving fast, you are better off\nto threshold-brake by pushing on the brake up to the point just before it locks. (See",

If this\ndoes not work, or if you are on a slight downgrade, try moving in second gear.\n\nIf you’re stuck in deep snow, try rocking your vehicle. To do this, start forward, gently\naccelerate and you will move forward a little.

When\nthe wheels spin again, stop immediately. Repeat the forward-backward rocking\nmovement, increasing the distance you move each time until you gain sufﬁcient\nmomentum to keep moving ahead. Be sure the wheels have stopped turning before\nchanging gears to avoid damage to your transmission.\n\nSearch for traction. Look for sand or grit. Choose snow rather than ice. A small\nmovement to one side will often move you from a low traction icy patch onto snow or\nsand. This motion can usually be completed in your lane.\n\nHow to stop on slippery surfaces\n1. Shift to neutral (or declutch) before you brake.\n   page 129.)\n3. Again, search for the best traction and position your vehicle to take advantage of it.\n4.

Using cruise control on wet or slippery roads.\n3. Forgetting that other drivers may not be making proper allowances for winter\n   conditions.\n4. Letting your gas tank drop below half full.\n\nWhiteouts\nWhiteouts occur when the sky, horizon and ground blend into one, making it\nvery difﬁcult to determine your position on the road.

Do not be deceived by the false comfort of a well-heated\n    car and wear indoor clothes on long journeys.\n\n    Before starting a long trip, listen to weather forecasts and pay attention to storm\n    warnings. If storms develop while you’re travelling, seriously consider stopping over in\n    a town or village, rather than continuing, when there is a possibility of being stranded.\n\n    If you are stranded:\n    1. Always stay with your vehicle.\n    2. Keep calm.\n    3. Lower your downwind-side windows slightly and open the heater air vent to get\n       fresh air into the vehicle.\n    4. Run the engine to get some heat, and to listen to news reports or charge your\n       cellphone but don’t run out of gas or drain your battery.\n    5. Keep your exhaust pipe clear of ice and snow.\n    6. Get into your emergency clothing before you get cold.\n    7. If necessary, use candles to keep warm. Be careful not to over-exert yourself by\n       shovelling or by pushing your vehicle.\n\n    Many people die when they leave their vehicles to walk for help in a blizzard. If you\n    stay with your vehicle, you have a better chance of surviving and are more likely to be\n    found.\n\n\n    6.9 Braking\n    The general procedure for braking is to begin early, apply light pressure and ease up\n    on the brake as the vehicle comes to a stop. Always brake with your right foot.\n\n    If you want to stop more quickly, push the brake down a little further. Remember, for\n    normal braking you control the stop by varying the pressure. Do not push the brake\n    down as far as it will go.\n\n    Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) – was introduced in the mid-1980s and has become\n    standard equipment on most newer vehicles. It was designed to help drivers maintain\n    some steering ability and avoid skidding while braking. In normal braking, ABS is not\n    activated. During hard braking, vehicles with ABS remain stable. The brakes do not\n    lock up, which means the driver has more steering control. How do you use ABS?\n    Press the brake ﬁrmly and do not release until the vehicle has stopped. Do not pump\n    your brakes; the ABS is doing it for you.\n\n    When the ABS is active, the brake pedal may pulsate and the car may shudder or\n    emit clunking noises. This can startle some drivers, causing them to release the brake,\n    but these things are normal and indicate the ABS is functioning properly.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.9 Braking\nYou may think that with ABS you can stop on a dime. This instantaneous stop is not\nrealistic. When braking on dry or wet roads your stopping distance will be about the\nsame as with conventional brakes.\n\nYou should allow for a longer stopping distance with ABS than with conventional\nbrakes when driving on gravel, slush and snow. This is because the rotating tire will\nstay on top of this low-traction road surface covering and effectively “ﬂoat” on this\nlayer.\n\nA non-ABS-braked vehicle can lock its tires and create a snow plow effect in front\nof the tires that may, in some cases, help slow the vehicle. These locked tires can\nsometimes ﬁnd more traction below this layer. It’s recommended you refer to your\nvehicle owner’s manual to become familiar with proper practices should your vehicle\nhave electronic stability control, traction control, or other safety features.\n\nthe wheels, i.e., you’re trying for the “threshold” just before lock-up.\nTo accomplish this, shift to neutral (declutch) and brake until you feel one or more\nwheels lock, then, ease up the brake slightly until the wheels are all rolling again.\nRe-apply pressure until you feel one of the wheels start to lock up, ease off slightly\nand continue this movement, tracking the threshold until you stop. As the vehicle\nslows, you can brake harder before lock-up will occur.\n\nThe more slippery the surface, the less you will be able to push the brake before a\nwheel locks.\n\nTo threshold brake well requires much effort and concentration. While it’s usually the\ntechnique of choice, it is almost impossible to do if you panic.\n",

If all four wheels do not lock at exactly the\nsame time, or if the surface under different tires varies, the vehicle may rotate a little\nbefore it ﬁnally stops. Even under the worst conditions (one wheel on ice, one wheel\non dry pavement), the vehicle will travel in a straight line, although it may revolve\naround a point in the middle of the vehicle.\n\nYou need very little pressure to lock the wheels on ice. As the traction increases, you\nmust increase the pressure to lock the wheels. On dry pavement, you really have to\nstomp on the brake to lock all four wheels simultaneously.

Turning the wheel in\n    the direction of the skid is correct, but complicated. A much simpler way to decide\n    what way to steer is to look where you want to go and steer there.\n\n    Never use cruise control when roads are wet or slippery or on gravel.\n\n    Skids resulting from braking\n    The remedy is the same in any skid resulting from braking, regardless of how many\n    wheels lock. Shift to neutral (declutch) and remove your foot from the brake. Look where\n    you want to go and steer there. By shifting to neutral, you will ensure that the skid does\n    not get worse and you will get the wheels rolling again so that you can steer.\n\n    You will probably have to correct the steering. Look where you want to go and steer\n    there. This will usually mean steering, counter-steering and straightening out.\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.10 Emergency driving\nSkids resulting from too much acceleration\nSometimes too much acceleration or using cruise control on a slippery surface will\ncause the vehicle to skid. To correct this situation, shift to neutral (declutch), take your\nfoot off the accelerator, look where you want to go and steer there. Do not touch the\nbrake. Some corrective steering may be necessary.\n\nSkids resulting from steering too sharply\nIf you turn the wheel too far to the left or right on a slippery surface, the front wheels\nwill skid straight ahead. To correct this, you must shift to neutral (declutch) and turn the\nwheel back towards the centre. As the wheels move to a position where they are turned\nless sharply, they will begin to grip again and you will be able to steer. You actually turn\nthe wheel in the opposite direction from which you wish to go until the wheels begin to\nroll. Only at this point do you look where you want to go and steer there.\n\n\n\n\nWhen in a skid, look where you want to go and steer there.\n\n\nWhen skids go too far\nSometimes, when a skid has gone too far, the vehicle will start to spin. You may not be\nable to stop the spinning, but you do have a choice of where it spins. Shift to neutral, if\nyou have time, and lock all four wheels. The vehicle will spin in a straight line, continuing\nin the direction in which it was last going. Usually, if you do this you can stay on the road.\n\nTo avoid getting into skids\nTo avoid getting into a skid, ﬁrst adjust your speed to the conditions, then look well\nahead so that you have plenty of time to react slowly and smoothly. If you must make\nany movements on a slippery surface, make them smoothly and gently and avoid\nsudden movements of the steering wheel.\n\nDo not turn a little problem into a tragedy\nMany collisions are caused by the driver’s over-reaction to a possible emergency\nsituation. If you ﬁnd yourself in an emergency situation, try to remain calm and take the\ntime to think before you act. As a skid develops, the earlier you take action, the smaller\nthe corrective movement required and the greater are your chances of controlling it.\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills\n      6.10 Emergency driving\n\n\n",

Animals are also especially active\n    in the late fall and early winter during mating\n    season and migration. The peak times for\n    collisions are dawn and dusk.\n\n    Watch your speed\n    Yellow wildlife warning signs indicate areas\n    of high risk. No matter the season or time\n    of day, it’s important to watch for signs of\n    wildlife and reduce your speed accordingly.\n    Slowing down reduces the distance\n    required to stop and decreases the force of\n    impact in the event of a collision.\n\n    Be alert\n    It’s important to constantly scan the road from shoulder to shoulder. Being alert is still\n    your best defence to prevent a collision. When you see an animal at the side of the\n    road, slow down and pass by slowly. For night driving, look for the glowing eyes of\n    animals and use your high beams whenever possible.\n\n\n\n\n Advanced driving skills\n6.10 Emergency driving\nWhen encountering an animal, try to do the following:\n• Remain calm if an animal appears on the road in front of you. If you have time to\n  stop, do so at a safe distance and stay alert. When one animal crosses the road,\n  others often follow. You can also sound your horn to scare wildlife away from the\n  road.\n• If an animal appears suddenly and surprises you, remember to brake ﬁrmly and stay\n  in control of your vehicle. Avoid swerving because you may turn into oncoming trafﬁc\n  or roll into the ditch.\n• If the animals are being herded or if you approach horseback riders you should slow\n  down and wait for the herder or rider to move the animals across the road or to one\n  side and indicate that it’s safe to proceed. Do not use your horn as it may panic or\n  scatter the animals.\n\nWhen a collision is unavoidable\nSometimes collisions with wildlife are unavoidable even if you take every precaution\nand remain alert at the wheel. In these circumstances, try to remain calm.\n• Aim your vehicle at the spot where the animal came from, not where it’s going.\n• Try for a glancing blow rather than a head-on encounter and let up on your brake just\n  before you collide. This causes the front of your vehicle to rise slightly and reduces\n  the chances of the animal going through your windshield.\n• Hitting an animal can be a traumatic experience. If possible, move to the shoulder\n  and turn on your hazard lights. Take a moment to regain your composure and then\n  assess the damage to your vehicle.\n• Don’t approach the animal, especially if it appears to be wounded. Injured animals\n  can be dangerous.\n• Call the police or your local RCMP detachment if there are human injuries or\n  signiﬁcant damage to your vehicle. If the damage is less severe, you may continue\n  driving and follow regular SGI claims reporting procedures.\n• Call the Conservation Ofﬁcer Service if there is a dead or injured animal to report.\n\n\n\n\n 6     Advanced driving skills",

Blood alcohol content (BAC) may be affected\n    by age, gender, physical condition, and amount of food consumed, medication and\n    other factors. Also, different mixed drinks contain different amounts of alcohol, so it’s\n    important to know how much alcohol has been consumed, not just how many drinks\n    the person has had.\n\n    Sequence of effects on the body\n    Alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream very quickly. As blood alcohol levels start to\n    rise, the brain becomes increasingly sedated or drugged.\n\n    1. Judgment                                  2.   Muscle control\n       The ﬁrst part of the body affected             The second part of the body affected\n       by alcohol is the brain, particularly          by alcohol is muscle control.

The part of the\n       brain that controls social inhibitions is\n       also affected, causing people to say\n       and do things they normally would\n       not. These effects start with one drink.\n\n    Many people wrongly assess their ability to drive after drinking by observing physical\n    dexterity (staggering, etc.). This is incorrect as the greatest percentage of alcohol-\n    related collisions result from faulty thinking during the identiﬁcation, prediction and\n    decision parts of the driving task and not as a result of poor execution (steering,\n    braking, etc.).\n\n\n Drinking, drugs and driving\n7.1 Alcohol\nThe brain functions that are ﬁrst affected by alcohol consumption are not only\nimportant to our ability to drive safely, but are the same ones required to make rational\ndecisions about not driving after drinking. For this reason, you must make the decision\nto separate your drinking and driving and make the necessary alternate transportation\nplans before you have that ﬁrst drink!\n\nIt doesn’t make sense to drive after drinking.

It can also cause paranoia,\ndrowsiness, distorted perception and a\nsense of disorientation – all of which could\ncause you to lose control at the wheel.\n\nSome experts claim that smoking a cannabis joint has roughly a similar level of\nimpairment on driving ability as drinking four pints of beer. Also, reports show that in\nthe majority of fatal collisions where cannabis has been detected in a driver’s body,\nalcohol has also been detected. Alcohol alone or in combination with cannabis\nincreases impairment, collision rate and collision responsibility (the same can be\napplied to other drugs too).\n\nDepressant drugs\nLike alcohol, other depressant drugs include sedatives\nor tranquillizers (used to treat anxiety, depression and\nsleeping disorders, e.g., valium), antihistamines (often\nused in ﬂu, allergy and hay fever remedies) and painkillers.\nThese drugs slow down your brain and body; they blunt\nalertness and reduce motor coordination. This affects a\nperson’s ability to drive safely in a way similar to alcohol.\nAny drug that causes drowsiness can also affect a\nperson’s ability to drive safely.\n\n\n\n\n 7     Drinking, drugs and driving\n      7.2 Drugs\n\n\n\n    People who drive after using any type of depressant can’t react as quickly when they\n    need to. Their vision is affected, and may be blurred or doubled. Depth perception is\n    altered, making it hard to tell whether other vehicles, pedestrians or objects are close\n    or far away. Their driving is more likely to be careless or reckless – weaving, speeding,\n    driving off the road, and (too often) crashing.\n\n    If the label advises against operating heavy machinery, consider it a warning not to get\n    behind the wheel of a vehicle.\n\n    Stimulants\n    Stimulant drugs, such as caffeine and amphetamines, may increase alertness, but this\n    does not mean they improve driving skills. The tired driver who drinks coffee to stay\n    awake on the road should be aware that the stimulant effect can wear off suddenly,\n    and that the only remedy for fatigue is to pull off the road and sleep. Amphetamines\n    do not seem to affect driving skills when taken at medical doses, but they do make\n    some people over-conﬁdent, which can lead to risky driving. Higher doses of\n    amphetamines often make people hostile and aggressive.\n\n    If you think drug taking has little, or even a positive impact on your driving, you could\n    be tragically mistaken. It’s important to bear in mind that it can be hard to determine\n    exactly how a drug will affect your driving ability – impairment caused by drugs can\n    vary according to the individual, drug type, dosage, the length of time the drug stays\n    in your body, or if the drug has been taken with other drugs or alcohol.\n\n    When taking prescription or over-the-counter medications, it’s wise to consult with\n    your doctor or pharmacist before driving.\n\n\n\n\n Drinking, drugs and driving\n7.2 Drugs",

Assume that a drink is:\n    • 1 bottle of regular alcohol content beer; or\n    • 5 ounces table wine; or\n    • 3 ounces fortiﬁed wine (port or sherry); or\n    • 1-1/2 ounce hard liquor (rye, rum, vodka etc.).\n\n    Combined with:\n    • anti-depressants\n    • gravol\n    • antihistamines\n    • valium\n\n\n\n\n Drinking, drugs and driving\nWe ﬁnd that there is a predictable synergistic effect related to the level of impairment\ncaused by a certain number of drinks when combined in this manner.\n\n   Number of                                                   Equivalent to Number\n                                  Combined With\n    Drinks                                                           of Drinks\n        2                 Antihistamine (Cold Remedy)              = 4 to 5\n        2                         Marijuana (1 joint)              = 5 to 6\n        2               Tranquilizer (Valium – normal dose)        = Approximately 6\n        2                              Gravol                      = Approximately 6\n\nIt must be noted that the dosage of the drug will have a serious effect on the\n“equivalence to number of drinks” estimates. Hydroponically grown marijuana, for\nexample, is much stronger than the light dosage drug used in compiling the ﬁgures for\nthis chart.\n\nIn all cases, the Intoxilyzer reading would indicate just the blood alcohol level caused\nby two drinks, but the actual impairment of central nervous system function would be\nequivalent to a much higher blood alcohol level.\n\nUnderstanding the synergistic effect of alcohol combined with other drugs could be a\nlifesaver.\n",

If you’re charged and\n    convicted of a criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the penalties are increased.\n\n    Dangerous driving\n    Failing to exercise reasonable care in the operation of a motor vehicle is an offence.\n\n    Failure to stop at scene of collision\n    If you’re involved in a collision with a person, vehicle or cattle in the charge of a\n    person, you must give your name, address, driver’s licence number and insurance\n    information to any other involved people and assist any injured people.\n\n    Drive while disqualiﬁed\n    If you drive while you’re disqualiﬁed, you could face additional charges, vehicle\n    impoundment, and other ﬁnancial consequences. It’s an offence under the Criminal\n    Code to drive while disqualiﬁed.\n\n    Arrest\n    You may be arrested if you:\n    • operate an unregistered vehicle\n    • drive without a driver’s licence\n    • fail to stop when signalled by police\n    • drive without care and attention or without reasonable consideration for others\n    • tamper with a vehicle\n    • fail to provide information when requested by police\n    • commit Criminal Code offences\n\n    You may be arrested if the police have reason to believe you will not appear in court to\n    answer your summons.\n\n    Licence disqualiﬁcations\n    If you’re convicted of any of the offences                    One conviction        1 year\n    discussed in this section, your licence will be               Two convictions       3 years\n    automatically cancelled and you will be disqualiﬁed           Three convictions     5 years\n    from driving. The period of disqualiﬁcation will be\n    based on the number of Criminal Code convictions\n    you have had in the last 10 years.\n    In addition to these automatic provincial disqualiﬁcations, the court may issue an order\n    prohibiting you from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other\n    public place anywhere in Canada for a period of time. You will not be allowed issue of\n    a full unrestricted driver’s licence until the expiration of the longer period, whether it is\n    the automatic disqualiﬁcation or the court order.\n\n\n\n\n Complying with the law when driving\n8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada\nReinstatement of driving privileges\nIf you’re convicted of a criminal offence you may be eligible for early reinstatement of\nyour driving privileges. Options for early reinstatement may include:\n• ignition interlock special restricted driver’s licence\n• special restricted driver’s licence\n\nThese options are issued on the provision that you have a zero tolerance for drugs\nand alcohol while driving. This means no detectable amount of alcohol or drugs in\nyour system.\n\nIgnition interlock special restricted driver’s licence\nThe Ignition Interlock program is a remedial program for drivers who have received\nimpaired driving suspensions or convictions. An ignition interlock device prevents\nyou from operating a vehicle if you have alcohol in your body. A device is installed in\nthe vehicle that is connected to the vehicle’s ignition that checks for the presence\nof alcohol in the driver. The driver must blow into the machine to start the car, and\ncontinue to periodically blow into the device to keep the car in motion. If the device\nsenses alcohol, the car will not start. If while in motion the device senses alcohol the\nhorn will start honking and headlights will ﬂash to draw attention to the vehicle. These\ncannot be stopped until the vehicle is turned off.\n\nThe ignition interlock special restricted licence is mandatory for the following:\n• Your conviction was for impaired driving, driving while equal to or over the legal limit for\n  alcohol or a combination of alcohol and drugs, or for failing to comply with a demand.\n• You received a third roadside suspension within the last 10 years and it’s alcohol-\n  related. (Note: If you received your ﬁrst two roadside licence suspensions as a new\n  driver, those count towards the number of offences as an experienced driver.)\n\nThe ignition interlock special restricted licence is voluntary for the following:\n• You received a second roadside licence suspension as a new driver within the last\n  10 years.\n• You received an indeﬁnite roadside administrative suspension for an alcohol-related\n  Criminal Code offence and you’ve served at least 90 days of your suspension.\n\nThe device must remain in the vehicle until the ignition interlock suspension period\nends. You cannot wait out your suspension period.\n\nEligibility and program duration\nThe Ignition Interlock program is mandatory for certain impaired driving offences, the\nlength of the mandatory term depends on how many prior offences the driver has in\nthe past 10 years, and the type of impaired driving offence.\n\n\n\n\n 8     Complying with the law when driving\n      8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada • 8.3 Trafﬁc tickets\n\n\n\n    You’re not eligible for early reinstatement of your driving privileges by installing an\n    ignition interlock device if you’ve been declared ineligible by a judge, your conviction\n    is not alcohol-related, or because you’ve been convicted under the Criminal Code of\n    Canada for any impaired driving offence causing bodily injury or death.\n\n    Special restricted driver’s licence\n    A restricted driver’s licence limits when and where you can drive. You may be granted\n    a restricted licence if you demonstrate that:\n    • the licence suspension would cause you exceptional hardship\n    • allowing for a restricted licence would not be contrary to public interest\n\n    You’re eligible to apply to the Highway Trafﬁc Board for a special restricted licence if\n    the following applies to you:\n    • Your conviction is non-alcohol/drug related and you have served the entire court-\n      ordered prohibition period and completed the required educational program.\n    • Your conviction is alcohol/drug related and you have completed the required\n      educational program and your mandatory ignition interlock term, and still must serve\n      the provincial suspension.\n    • You paid the $75 reinstatement fee.\n\n\n    8.3 Trafﬁc tickets\n    When the police charge you with a violation, they’ll issue a ticket indicating the\n    offence you committed as well as the date, time and location. The ticket will also\n    indicate where and when you are to appear in court. Some tickets, including those for\n    stunting, racing and driving at excessive speeds, will result in an immediate roadside\n    suspension.\n\n    For some less serious offences, the ticket will indicate the amount of the ﬁne you must\n    pay. If you choose to plead guilty, you may pay your ﬁne voluntarily through the mail or\n    online, if available.\n\n    You must appear in court to enter a not guilty plea. You’ll then have a trial date set.\n    You may want to consult a lawyer before entering a plea.\n\n\n\n\n Complying with the law when driving\n8.4 Driver Improvement Program\n8.4 Driver Improvement Program\nThe Driver Improvement Program monitors the driving records of all Saskatchewan\ndrivers. The program aims to make Saskatchewan roads safer for everyone by\nreducing the incidence of high-risk behaviours by motorists.\n\nImpaired driving is one example of high-risk driving, but many motorists endanger\nthe lives of others through behaviours that frequently cause motor vehicle collisions,\nincluding speeding, running red lights and stunting.\n\nUnder this program, drivers are assigned points every time they are convicted of a\ntrafﬁc offence or have an at-fault collision. Drivers who reach their maximum threshold\nof points are sent a warning letter to advise that tougher sanctions will follow should\ntheir driving record continue to deteriorate.\n\nDrivers who continue their high-risk behaviour face consequences that include ﬁnes,\ndriver’s licence re-testing, driver’s licence suspensions of up to six months and\ncompletion of a driver improvement training program.\n\nFor more information on the Driver Improvement Program, call 1-844-TLK-2SGI\n(1-844-855-2744).\n\n                                 Penalty                             Demerit points\n\n Program information letter                                        9 or more points\n Warning letter                                                    12 or more points\n Defensive Driving Course                                          15 or more points\n Driver Improvement Training                                       18 or more points\n 30-day suspension                                                 21 or more points\n 90-day suspension                                                 24 or more points\n 180-day suspension                                                27 or more points\n Driver Improvement interview and penalty                          30 or more points\n SGI manual review and penalty                                     33 or more points\n\n\n\n\n 8       Complying with the law when driving\n\n\n\n    The Safe Driver Recognition (SDR) program rewards safe drivers with a discount on\n    their vehicle insurance.\n\n    If you own or lease a vehicle registered in Class LV, PV or F (one ton model or\n    smaller), you may be eligible to receive a discount on your vehicle insurance premium.\n    That discount will apply to every qualifying vehicle you insure.\n\n    On the other hand, the program also ensures drivers who demonstrate risky behaviour\n    pay their share in ﬁnancial penalties - helping offset the costs of the discount for safe\n    drivers.\n",

            "content": "The Safety Zone – Discounts\nFor every year since 1995 that you have driven without an incident, you earn a safety\npoint. Each point in the Safety Zone corresponds to a discount on your vehicle plate\ninsurance, to a maximum of 25%.\n\nEven if you don’t own a vehicle, a positive rating in the Safety Zone is beneﬁcial to\nyou. It protects all safe drivers from ﬁnancial penalties if they are involved in future\nincidents.\n\nYou only receive a ﬁnancial penalty for an incident if it causes you to lose enough\npoints to move you to the Penalty Zone on the scale. As long as you remain in the\nSafety Zone, you continue to receive some level of discount.\n\nYou’re eligible for a Safe Driver Recognition discount on your registered motorcycle\nplates, if you get:\n• To the Novice 2 stage of the Motorcycle Graduated Driver Licensing program and\n  take an SGI -approved motorcycle training course, or\n• Your full M Endorsement.\n\n3 discount zones\n• Good Drivers Zone (+1 to +10) - If you’re in the Good Drivers Zone, you have\n  earned enough safety rating points to receive a discount on your basic vehicle\n  insurance. For each year you drive incident-free, you earn a safety rating point that\n  gives you 2% off your basic vehicle insurance.\n• Great Drivers Zone (+11 to +20) - If you’re in the Great Drivers Zone, you have\n  earned enough safety rating points to receive a 20% discount on your basic vehicle\n  insurance, plus you have earned a cushion to shield you from losing some or all of\n  your discount if you cause a collision or get trafﬁc convictions in the future.\n• Safest Drivers Zone (+21 to +25) - If you’re in the Safest Drivers Zone, you have\n  driven incident-free for more than 20 years. You earn an extra 1% discount for each\n  additional year you drive incident-free up to a maximum discount of 25%.\n\nThe Penalty Zone – Financial penalties\nDrivers lose points for unsafe driving - such as being at fault for a collision or certain\ntrafﬁc convictions and roadside suspensions. Driving disqualiﬁcations automatically\nmove drivers to -20 or lower, regardless of where they were on the scale prior.\n\nFinancial penalties are assessed for incidents that result in a safety rating below zero.\n• You’re assessed a ﬁnancial penalty of $50 for each point you move in the Penalty\n  Zone (capped at a maximum penalty of $1,000).\n• The further an incident moves you into the Penalty Zone, the more you pay for that\n  incident. The maximum penalty noted above applies to most incidents, with the\n  exception of certain Criminal Code convictions.

Depending on your driving habits\nand how often you drive, these basic techniques and useful tips could save you\nhundreds of dollars a year in fuel and maintenance costs:\n\n• It’s both safer and more fuel efﬁcient to maintain a steady speed on a road.\n  Accelerate smoothly when passing or merging with faster trafﬁc and avoid hard\n  braking. European tests have shown that aggressive driving, including frequent rapid\n  acceleration and hard braking, can increase fuel consumption by approximately\n  40%.\n• Drive at the posted speed limit. Lowering your highway cruising speed from\n  120 km/h to 100 km/h will reduce fuel consumption by up to 20%.\n• Plan your trips to combine errands and to avoid trafﬁc jams, steep hills, road\n  construction, etc. Combining a number of short trips into one longer one allows your\n  engine and drivetrain to reach peak operating temperature, which is not possible on\n  trips of less than 5 km. Avoiding trouble spots shortens your travel time and reduces\n  unnecessary idling.\n• If you are driving a vehicle with a manual transmission, learn how to use it properly\n  for maximum fuel savings. A tachometer can help you shift the transmission at the\n  most fuel-efﬁcient engine speeds (the owner’s manual will indicate these speeds).\n• If you have cruise control, use it for highway driving to maintain a constant speed.\n  The exception is on hilly terrain, where it’s a good idea to allow the vehicle’s speed\n  to drop slightly going uphill and then let gravity help you build up speed again (to a\n  safe level) going down the other side.\n• In summer, minimize your use of air conditioning. Operating an air conditioner in\n  hot weather can increase fuel consumption by more than 20% in city driving.\n  A more fuel-efﬁcient option for staying cool is to open a window. However, at\n  highway speeds, use your car’s ﬂow-through ventilation – open windows and\n  sunroofs increase aerodynamic drag, which makes the engine work harder and\n  consume more fuel. If you must use your vehicle’s air conditioning, avoid running\n  it continuously. Shut it off after the interior is cool or set the controls to a comfort\n  level that allows the system to cycle.\n• Check tire pressure at least once a month when the tires are cold (i.e., the vehicle\n  has been stationary for at least three hours or has not been driven more than 2 km).\n  If you have to drive more than 2 km to add air, check the tires before you leave and\n  then add the amount of air that is missing from this reading. Inﬂate the tires to the\n  recommended pressure, usually indicated on the car door, glove compartment or\n  in the owner’s manual. With proper tire inﬂation, your car will burn less fuel and\n  be safer to drive. A vehicle with tires that are under-inﬂated by a total of 10 psi\n  increases fuel consumption by 5%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Use a block heater in the winter to warm the engine oil and make cold starts easier\n  on your engine components. Your vehicle’s oil doesn’t freeze when the temperature\n  dips below 0˚C, but it does get much thicker. This means your engine has to work\n  harder and use more fuel. Use a timer to switch the block heater on two hours\n  before you plan to drive. Proper use of a block heater can improve your vehicle’s\n  overall fuel economy by as much as 10%. Still, don’t leave your block heater on\n  overnight or your energy savings will disappear in a higher electricity bill.\n• Follow the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended operating procedures and\n  maintenance schedule in your owner’s manual. Regular maintenance such as oil and\n  ﬁlter changes will not only prevent early degeneration of your vehicle’s components,\n  it will also keep them operating at their most fuel-efﬁcient level. A clogged air\n  ﬁlter can increase fuel consumption by up to 10%. Regular maintenance will keep\n  your vehicle operating safely, save you money and, at the same time, help the\n  environment.\n• Remote car starters are handy on cold winter mornings, but don’t start your car\n  too soon. In most driving conditions, today’s modern engines need less warm-up\n  time even on cold mornings. Also, allowing your car to idle too long wastes gas and\n  produces unnecessary exhaust emissions.\n• Idling for more than 10 seconds, except in trafﬁc, wastes more fuel than stopping\n  your engine and restarting again. At the end of the day, stopping unnecessary idling\n  will beneﬁt the environment and save you money.\n ",
