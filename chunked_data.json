    "content": "\n2. Saskatchewan\u2019s driver\u2019s licence program\nDriver programs and examinations are designed to develop safe and capable drivers who know and understand the rules of the road. Driving is a responsibility and a privilege. It\u2019s not a right. Provincial regulations exist to meet safety needs as well as promote the efficient and safe flow of traffic.\n\nTo drive in Saskatchewan you must hold a valid driver\u2019s licence for the type of vehicle you wish to operate. The classified driver\u2018s licence system establishes minimum standards of skill, knowledge, physical and mental fitness for the safe operation of different types of vehicles. Drivers are then licensed accordingly.\n\nThe first time you apply for a Saskatchewan driver\u2019s licence, you\u2019ll be asked to provide documents to prove your identity, proof of residency and entitlement to be in Canada. Each document must be from an authority such as a federal or provincial government or a federal agency (a full list of approved documents can be found at sgi.sk.ca/identity-and-residency-verification and in SGI\u2019s Establishing Your Identity pamphlet). They must also be originals, not photocopies. Electronic scans of these documents may be kept on file, in keeping with Canadian standards.\n\nTo get a driver\u2019s licence, you must be able to operate a vehicle safely and properly, understand all traffic signs and know the rules of the road. You\u2019re required to complete a driver\u2019s examination if you:\n\u2022 Have never been a licensed driver;\n\u2022 Have not held a Saskatchewan driver\u2019s licence or specific Class or Endorsement within the past five years;\n\u2022 Wish to become a certified driver instructor in Saskatchewan;\n\u2022 Want to change the class of your licence or obtain an endorsement; or\n\u2022 Are a new resident, and the licence you hold is from another province, state or country not honoured or recognized in Saskatchewan. Licences may be honoured from the United States. Licences from Germany, Switzerland, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Isle of Man, Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Japan, Jersey, Netherlands, New Zealand, Ukraine and Taiwan may be exchanged for a Saskatchewan Class 5 driver\u2019s licence and motorcycle endorsement, where applicable. Saskatchewan may also accept a driver\u2019s licence from a country not listed. Please check with any Saskatchewan motor licence issuer, driver examination office, or visit www.sgi.sk.ca/newresidents or contact us toll free at 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744). The nine-month learning period and driver training requirement may be waived if you can prove past driving experience by providing a valid driver\u2019s licence, written in English or French, or a valid licence in another language accompanied by a translation document acceptable to SGI (i.e. International Driving Permit).\n\nIf you\u2019re a new resident wanting a Saskatchewan driver\u2019s licence without being tested, you must meet some requirements:\n\u2022 If you\u2019re a former resident of a Canadian province or territory you must have a valid driver\u2019s licence from that jurisdiction. An expired driver\u2019s licence (not older than five years) from that jurisdiction is also acceptable. New residents may drive with their valid out-of-province driver\u2019s licence for 90 days after moving to Saskatchewan.\n",

        "content": "All vehicles must be properly registered according to purpose and must display the appropriate licence plate.\n\nLicence plates must be securely attached and clearly visible. That means plates must not be obstructed in a way that prevents them from being read or accurately photographed by any enforcement system.\n\nThe number or identity of the licence plate must not be altered or changed in any way.\n\nIf you're a new resident you have up to 90 days to register your vehicle in Saskatchewan. Basic insurance coverage is required. A non-resident (someone who does not own, rent or lease a residence in Saskatchewan and, if required, does not pay Saskatchewan income tax) may drive in Saskatchewan indefinitely providing your out-of-province or out-of-country driver's licence remains valid.\n\nHow auto insurance works in Saskatchewan\n\nSaskatchewan auto insurance comes in two parts:\n\nBasic minimum coverage – Is required by law and is purchased at the same time you pay for your licence plates and vehicle registration. This coverage is compulsory and is provided by SGI.\n\nAdditional coverage – Sometimes referred to as extended auto insurance, a package policy or an Auto Pak, additional coverage is tailored to your needs and is provided on a separate auto insurance policy. This important protection may be purchased from the insurance company, broker or agent of your choice.\n\nLicence plate insurance coverage\n\nYour licence plate carries basic insurance coverage in three areas:\n\nCollision and comprehensive – Coverage for damage to your vehicle, subject to a deductible.\n\nPersonal injury – Benefits for personal injury resulting from a vehicle collision.\n\nLiability – Insurance for damage your vehicle causes to another vehicle or property, or injury to others.\n\nCollision and comprehensive is also known as physical damage coverage. It pays for damage to your vehicle due to a collision or other occurrence such as hail, fire or theft.*\n\nPersonal injury benefits provide Saskatchewan residents with injury and death benefits if they are injured or killed in an automobile collision anywhere in Canada or the United States. All Saskatchewan residents have a choice between two equally priced auto injury coverages – No Fault Coverage and Tort Coverage.\n\n* Most vehicles are covered to the actual cash value, which is the market value of your vehicle compared with similar vehicles, with similar equipment, mileage and condition to the insured vehicle (see Coverage Limitations referenced in the Driver’s Licence and Basic Insurance brochure).\n\n Liability coverage protects you as a vehicle owner and driver if you and/or your\\n vehicle are responsible for injuries caused to others or damage to property belonging\\n to others. \u2018Others\u2019 may be another motorist, a pedestrian or bicyclist, a passenger in\\n your vehicle, or the owner of property you damage.\\n\\nTo be liable is to be at fault and responsible for damage or injury. You can be\\n liable whether you choose No Fault or Tort injury (all Saskatchewan residents are\\n automatically covered with No Fault injury coverage unless they choose Tort injury\\n coverage and file a declaration form). Liability coverage will pay the cost to defend\\n you if someone claims you are liable, as well as the damages if you are found\\n responsible.\\n\\nPlate insurance provides up to $200,000 in liability coverage. Although\\n compensation for many injuries and damages is covered under the collision\\n and comprehensive coverage or the personal injury benefits, there are also many\\n situations where compensation will be based on who is at fault, what happened and\\n where it happened (for instance, if you were driving in the U.S. or another Canadian\\n province). These include damage to buildings or fences near a street, to cargo in a\\n vehicle you collide with, or to trains, cargo, and tracks at a level crossing, including\\n environmental damage. If you\u2019re responsible for an injury or death in Saskatchewan of\\n someone whose earnings were greater than the personal injury benefit amount, or to\\n anyone out of province, you will likely have a liability claim.\\n\\nNo Fault Coverage\\nSaskatchewan residents with No Fault Coverage receive a comprehensive package\\n of benefits regardless of the circumstances of the collision. Benefits include coverage\\n for income loss, medical and rehabilitation expenses, permanent impairment and\\n death benefits. Those with No Fault Coverage can sue for certain expenses not\\n covered by their benefits, as well as for income loss which exceeds the benefits\\n provided by the plan. Except in very limited circumstances, they cannot sue for pain\\n and suffering.\\n\\nTort Coverage\\nSaskatchewan residents with Tort Coverage receive a basic package of benefits\\n regardless of the circumstances of the collision. Benefits include some coverage for\\n income loss, medical and rehabilitation expenses, permanent impairment and death\\n benefits. Those with Tort Coverage who are not totally at fault for the collision can\\n sue for expenses and income losses not covered by their benefits and for pain and\\n suffering, subject to a $5,000 deductible.\\n\\nFor more information on No Fault Coverage, Tort Coverage or how to choose your\\n auto injury insurance, visit [www.sgi.sk.ca](https://www.sgi.sk.ca) or ask any SGI office or SGI motor licence\\n issuing office for informational materials that explain the coverages.\\n\\nYour vehicle deductible\\nYour plate insurance covers loss of, or damage to, your vehicle and its equipment\\n from causes such as a collision, upset, fire, theft, windstorm or hail. Subject to your\\n deductible.\\n\\nA deductible is applicable to any vehicle loss you may have. It\u2019s the amount you\\n are required to pay before your licence plate insurance benefits begin to cover the\\n remaining costs.\\n\\nFor example, if your deductible is $700 and you\u2019re responsible for a collision which\\n causes $2,000 worth of damage to your vehicle, then SGI will pay for damage in\\n excess of your deductible. You\u2019ll be responsible for the first $700, while SGI will pay\\n the remaining $1,300.\\n\\nHowever, if it\u2019s determined that another Saskatchewan driver/owner is responsible\\n for the damage and that person can be identified, that person\u2019s insurance will pay\\n for your damage, including your deductible and any other reasonable out-of-pocket\\n expenses.\\n\\nCoverage for specific single-vehicle losses\\nSingle-vehicle collision \u2013 Your damages are covered for the amount in excess of your\\n deductible. You may be able to recover your deductible when there is a responsible\\n party to pursue. Your adjuster will assist you with this. In most single-vehicle collisions\\n the driver is responsible and must pay their own deductible.\\n\\nStorm or weather-related damage \u2013 Even though you\u2019re not at fault for weather-\\n related damage, such as hail damage or a tree falling on your vehicle, the deductible\\n applies as there is no responsible party to pursue.\\n\\nCollision with an animal \u2013 If you carry only the compulsory plate insurance, the\\n deductible applies. If you carry additional auto insurance the deductible may be\\n waived for a collision with an animal.\\n\\nHit and run \u2013 Your damages are covered for the amount in excess of your deductible.\\n You may be able to recover your deductible if the responsible party is identified. Your\\n adjuster will assist you with this.\\n\\nTheft or vandalism \u2013 If you carry only the compulsory plate insurance, the deductible\\n applies. If the responsible party is identified, you may be able to recover your\\n deductible. If you carry additional auto insurance the deductible may be waived for\\n theft of the entire vehicle.\\n\\nCoverage for multiple-vehicle losses\\nYou\u2019re not at fault for the collision \u2013 You don\u2019t pay the deductible in most cases. The\\n party found at fault for the collision is responsible for your damage, including your\\n deductible. Once your adjuster has confirmed your coverage, you may have your\\n vehicle repaired at the autobody shop of your choice.\\n\\nYou\u2019re at fault for the collision \u2013 As the at-fault driver you\u2019re responsible for your full\\n deductible. Your licence plate insurance will also pay the other driver\u2019s deductible and\\n cover any damage to their vehicle.\\n\\nShared responsibility for the collision \u2013 When two motorists are each found partially\\n responsible for a collision, both drivers pay a portion of their deductible if their vehicle\\n is damaged. For example, if you\u2019re found 25% responsible for a collision you pay 25%\\n of your deductible.\\n\\nPersonal Auto Injury Insurance\\nThe Personal Auto Injury Insurance program provides coverage for Saskatchewan\\n residents injured in automobile collisions anywhere in Canada or the United States.\\n Coverage provided depends on which of two auto injury products you choose \u2013 No\\n Fault Coverage or Tort Coverage.\\n\\nExtended Auto Insurance\\nBasic plate insurance allows you to drive with minimal coverage, but to protect\\n yourself, your family, your passengers, and your vehicle, you may find you\u2019ll need more\\n than just the basics. A licensed insurance broker or agent will explain your options\\n and provide advice on economical ways to obtain the protection you need.\\n\\nExtended auto insurance can cover your vehicle for replacement cost, pay for the\\n cost of a rental if your vehicle is damaged, reduce the deductible you pay for damage\\n to your vehicle and top-up your injury coverage. Most importantly, it increases your\\n liability from the minimum $200,000.\\n\\nDespite your efforts to be a good driver, a moment of distraction, tiredness,\\n inexperience, poor road conditions and many other things can result in major\\n collisions. You can be sued and held responsible for damages if you\u2019re at fault \u2013 even\\n if you have No Fault injury coverage. If you don\u2019t have enough insurance or the means\\n to pay for your defence or the damages caused, you may be expected to pay\\n a portion of your earnings for many years as a result of lacking enough coverage.\\n",

    "title": "BASIC INFORMATION AND RULES OF THE ROAD",
    "content": "The six basic driving conditions\n\nDriver condition refers to your physical, mental and emotional fitness to drive. It’s the most important of the six conditions, because a driver in top physical, mental and emotional shape can adjust to all the other conditions and to the errors of other drivers as well.\n\nVehicle condition affects your ability to control your vehicle, your ability to see and be seen, and to communicate with other drivers and pedestrians. Your chances of staying out of a collision are better with a vehicle in tip-top condition than they are with one that has operational defects. You are the only one who knows when something isn’t working right. Only you can spot possible vehicle defects and either repair them or get them corrected by a qualified mechanic.\n\nLight condition: The first requirement of safe driving is to see and be seen. This ability is affected by light condition. The presence of natural or artificial light; you can have too little light, or too much light. The hazard of too little light is found in the fact that the nighttime fatal collision rate is more than double the daytime rate.\n\nWeather condition: Bad weather can affect traction, visibility and vehicle control. Rain, snow and ice make road surfaces slippery. Adverse weather can obscure your vision with rain, snow, fog or road splatter, as well, steam up glass with interior vapour. Other drivers find it harder to see you, and pedestrians hide behind umbrellas so they fail to see cars approaching. High winds make steering difficult and cause vehicles to veer to the wrong side of the road.\n\nRoad condition refers to the total roadway and the type and condition of the road surface. These can affect your ability to steer, stop and manoeuvre. Adverse road conditions can be produced by weather. Conditions change from one kind of road to another – from a side street to a thoroughfare, from a secondary road to a main highway, from a two-lane road to an expressway. Any trip may involve a number of different road conditions, each requiring an adjustment in your driving.",

        "content": "Traffic condition\nTraffic conditions are created by the number of vehicles and pedestrians using the same road or street at the same time you are, and to a large extent by how well the road has been engineered to accommodate the amount of traffic present at a given time. More cars mean more conflict in traffic and more chance for a collision. Traffic conditions are influenced by the time of day, day of the week, even time of year in the case of holiday periods, and by the nature of the environment, such as a shopping centre, sports arena, factory or school.\n\nThere are speed limits on all Saskatchewan roads, streets and highways. Always drive your vehicle within the posted speed limit. Emergency vehicles responding to an emergency may exceed the speed limit. On most provincial highways, and in urban areas, speed limit signs are posted. In the absence of signs, the speed limit is 80 km/h. Most urban centres post speed limit signs at the entrances to the town or city. Those speed limits apply to all locations within community boundaries, unless otherwise posted. The speed limit means the fastest you can travel under ideal conditions. Stunting and racing can have serious and often life-threatening consequences.\n\nSome of the things that could land you a ticket, licence suspension and impoundment are:\n• racing side by side with another vehicle while disobeying the speed limit\n• chasing another vehicle\n• speeding in and out of lanes to unsafely pass vehicles\n• attempting to lift some or all tires from the roadway (including driving a motorcycle on one wheel)\n• attempting to spin a vehicle to cause it to spin or circle\n• driving a vehicle while not sitting in the driver’s seat\n• driving your vehicle in a way that prevents another vehicle from passing\n• stopping or slowing down to interfere with the movement of another vehicle\n\nThe maximum speed limit when passing tow trucks or emergency vehicles that are stopped with their lights flashing or when passing Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure equipment with lights flashing, whether in motion or not, is 60 km/h. Within the work zone (road maintenance areas), motorists are required to slow down and travel no faster than the posted speed. Fines for speeding triple when passing highway workers or equipment occupied by a worker in the work zone. Some cities have bylaws requiring drivers to obey work zone speed limits through the entire construction area. Please be familiar with the bylaws in your area. Drivers are also required to reduce their speed to 60 km/h when passing a tow truck stopped on the roadside with its amber or amber and blue lights flashing while it’s assisting to a disabled vehicle.\n\nIn school zones drivers must be particularly careful. Each city or town sets speed limits in school zones through local bylaws. As a result, laws vary from place to place so watch for signs. If there are no signs, you should still reduce your speed and proceed cautiously in school zones.",

Photo radar tickets are issued to the registered owner of the speeding vehicle driven through the zone. You must slow down when approaching animals on or near the road. Regardless of the posted or basic speed limit you must never travel faster than conditions allow for safe and reasonable passage. At the same time, travelling too slowly can be hazardous. You should never drive at a speed slow enough to impede or block other traffic, unless proper safety precautions have been taken.\n\nAlways drive with care, attention and reasonable consideration for other road users. It’s illegal for you, or any of your passengers, to perform stunts or other activities that distract, startle or interfere with other road users.\n\nDriver inattention and distraction is responsible for 14% of all collisions. On average, it leads to 19 fatalities a year in Saskatchewan (based on an average from 2019 – 2021).\n\nDriving requires you to do more than two things at once – steering, braking, shifting gears and watching for traffic all occur at the same time. When you add distractions like eating, grooming, talking or texting on cellphones, the results can be disastrous. Drivers should devote their full attention to driving. Some of the most common driver distractions include persons, objects or events outside the vehicle, distraction from passengers, looking for or at something in the vehicle, adjusting radio, climate or vehicle controls, smoking and eating or drinking.\n\nYou also shouldn’t distract other road users - deliberately creating loud and unnecessary noise with a motor vehicle is not permitted.",

            "content": "The large truck is a special vehicle. Its motor is not much larger than a large car engine and yet the load it carries can be 50 or more times the weight of a car. When accelerating up to speed, truck drivers use up to 18 gear changes. Once they get into top gear, they do not appreciate having to start again. Therefore, avoid forcing a truck driver to slow down.\n\nLarge trucks will decrease speed when going uphill. You can expect truck drivers to pick up speed when going down hills to help them get up the other side. Plan your passing manoeuvre accordingly.\n\nIt takes longer to stop a large truck than a car, so a truck driver needs a longer following distance to be safe and in control. Don’t cut in front of a large truck immediately after you have passed it.\n\nTruck drivers have problems seeing smaller vehicles. Although they have mirrors that help them to see each side, you may not be visible to the driver if you follow too closely. (Besides, you can’t see anything yourself.) Realize that in poor weather, exterior mirrors become spotted with rain and dirt and the truck driver doesn’t have an interior mirror. Be sure to make yourself visible. Drive with your headlights on.\n\nThe driver of a large truck or bus has difﬁculty turning sharp corners, particularly to the right. If the driver follows the proper procedure, vehicles facing them on the street they are entering should be prepared for the large truck or bus to enter their half of the roadway. If the large truck operator is not following the proper procedure, vehicles on their right in the street they are leaving should stay well back to avoid being crushed between the large truck and the curb. When you see a large truck or bus making a sharp right turn, give it the room it needs.\n\nAll drivers should avoid a large truck’s “no-zone.” The no-zone refers to the blindspot areas around big trucks, where crashes are most likely to occur. Just like cars, large trucks have blindspots on both sides, but a large truck’s are considerably bigger. These blindspots can mean trouble if a trucker decides to change lanes and a car is in the blindspot. In addition to the blindspots on the sides of a large truck, drivers should be careful around the front end of large trucks.\n\nTruckers sit up high and the hood of the cab obscures part of the road ahead. This is why when drivers in a car are passing a large truck, they should make sure they can see the entire truck cab in their rear-view mirror before pulling in front. If a car cuts in too soon, truck drivers are forced to react with little time or room to spare. Large trucks also have deep rear blindspots. A good rule of thumb is that if you can’t see the large truck’s mirrors, the truck driver can’t see you.",

Sometimes you will need to enter or cross a bike lane to turn right at a corner or driveway. Take extra care when you do this. Enter the bike lane only after ensuring that you can do so safely, and then make the turn.\n\nWhen you’re sharing the road with cyclists please remember:\n• Many children riding bicycles on the street are very young and lack the necessary training and skills for safe cycling.\n• When passing or overtaking a cyclist, go around them like you would any other vehicle.\n• Watch for cyclists’ hand signals. A cyclist may indicate a right-hand turn by extending their right arm. If possible, try to make eye contact with cyclists.\n• When turning left, you must stop and wait for oncoming bicycles to pass before turning.\n• When driving through an intersection, be careful to scan for cyclists waiting to turn left.\n• When you’re preparing to make a right turn, watch for cyclists who may pull up alongside your vehicle. Check your blind spots.\n• When making a right turn, do not pull up beside a cyclist and then turn directly in front of them and cut them off.\n• When pulling away from the curb always check for cyclists who may be travelling near the right edge of the lane or curb.\n• When parked at the curb, always check for cyclists when you open your vehicle door.\n• Give cyclists space with a safe following distance. They do not have brake lights to warn you when they’re slowing or stopping.\n• Cyclists are entitled to make left turns the same way as motorists. Since they are exposed on left turns, they will need extra consideration, especially on multi-lane roads.\n• It’s easy to misjudge the speed of bicycles — they can travel faster than you think! Experienced cyclists can travel at 25-35 km/h on a ﬂat surface and up to 50km/h going downhill.\n• Cyclists are entitled to ride at least one metre from the curb and may ride even further out when they steer away from drainage grates, potholes, debris, loose gravel or sand, wet or slippery surfaces, rutted or grooved pavement and even dogs. Be aware of the roadway conditions that may affect a cyclist.\n• Don’t use your horn when you’re passing a cyclist. It may frighten them and cause them to steer into your path. If you feel that you must use your horn, tap it quickly and lightly while you are still some distance away from the cyclist.\n\nThere’s also a class of bicycle called power-assisted bicycles, commonly known as e-bikes or electric bicycles and many are designed to look like scooters equipped with pedals. These types of vehicles use an electric motor to help the operator up to a maximum speed of 32 km/h. Treat them the same way you would any other cyclist.",

In road work zones, motorists must travel no faster than the posted speed. Fines for speeding triple near workers or occupied equipment. Some cities require compliance with the work zone speed from start to finish; know local bylaws. Reduce speed to 60 km/h near tow trucks assisting disabled vehicles with flashing amber or amber/blue lights.\n\nIn school zones, be cautious and reduce speed, following posted limits.

To help you spot and prevent a potential collision, use the following method.\n\nScenario:\nYou’re driving on a road towards an intersection and spot another vehicle approaching the same intersection. You don’t know how fast the other vehicle is travelling or how far away it is from the intersection. To help you determine if a collision is imminent, maintain your speed and course, and turn your head to take note of the other vehicle’s position in relation to you. Continue to maintain your speed and course for a few seconds and check the other vehicle’s position again by turning your head. If the other vehicle is still at the same position, you’re on a collision course. Start slowing down, and be prepared to yield or stop to avoid a collision.\n\nIt’s important to turn your head while looking for approaching vehicles and not rely on your peripheral vision only. Peripheral vision is very good at picking out objects that are moving; however, in the above scenario the other vehicle would appear to be not moving as it’s in a fixed position in your peripheral view."

Some adjust automatically, others work like a window blind. Adjust your shoulder belt to make it snug, yet comfortable. Shoulder belts should never be worn behind your back or under your arm.\n\nDrivers are legally responsible to ensure that passengers under 16 years of age use seatbelts where available and child safety seats, when appropriate.

An automatic transmission placed in drive “D” is designed to change gears automatically without any driver assistance. This type of transmission selects the most efficient gear based on speed and acceleration.\n\nIt’s possible for the driver to make an automatic transmission shift by simply using the accelerator pedal:\n\nTo shift to a higher gear - ease up slightly on the accelerator.\n\nTo shift to a lower gear - push the accelerator to the floor. This technique is used for passing or to get out of an emergency situation quickly.\n\nWhen driving down a steep hill, you can slow your vehicle by manually shifting to a lower gear and using engine compression as a braking effect. Simply move the gear shift lever from the drive “D” position to the next lower gear (usually third or second gear). It is recommended to make your gear selection at the top of the hill before you start going down. If you have to make the shift while driving down the hill, release the accelerator and use your brake to slow the vehicle down before moving the shift lever. To avoid engine damage, pay attention to ensure that the rpm’s stay out of the red zone as you shift to a lower gear. You should use the brakes only as needed. Holding the brake pedal for an extended length of time may cause the brakes to overheat, which can result in a loss of braking ability."

Check your surroundings:\n   • Always check behind your vehicle before backing up.\n   • Children, pets, bicycles, wagons, etc., aren’t always visible from inside your vehicle.\n   • Make sure the path is clear before you start backing up.\n2. Prepare your vehicle:\n   • All backing manoeuvres should begin with the vehicle straight and the front wheels straight.\n   • Adjust your mirrors and ensure your backup camera (if equipped) is clean and operational.\n3. Using the backup camera:\n   • Check all angles — while backup cameras are helpful, they don’t capture everything. Always turn your head to look out the rear window and check in all directions.\n   • Mirrors and camera — use your mirrors in conjunction with the backup camera to get a comprehensive view of your surroundings.\n4. Proper positioning for backing:\n   • From your normal seating position, shift your weight so that you’re resting on your right hip.\n   • Support yourself by placing your right arm along the armrest or the top of the front passenger seat.\n   • Grasp the top centre (12 o’clock position) of the steering wheel with your left hand.\n5. Starting to back up:\n   • While looking out the rear window, begin backing slowly in a straight line. Within the first foot or so of vehicle movement, check forward. If the front of the vehicle is moving straight back, your front wheels are straight. If the front of the vehicle swings to the left or right, your wheels are not straight.\n   • If the front of your vehicle swings to the left, turn your steering wheel to the left to straighten. If the front swings to the right, turn your steering wheel to the right to straighten. Once you get the wheels straight, move your grip to the new 12 o’clock position.\n   • Having done this, you know that every time your hand is at 12 o’clock, your front wheels are straight.\n\n6. Focus and control:\n   • Look through the rear window and focus your eyes well back along the path you want to go.\n   • Move the vehicle slowly backward. Look and steer where you want to go.\n   • You’ll notice that the vehicle turns much more when you are backing because the front wheels are pivoting, or swinging, around the rear wheels. This is called ‘front end swing’ and is the cause of many backing collisions.\n\nAdditional tips for using technology\n• Backup sensors: Many vehicles are equipped with backup sensors that alert you if you’re getting too close to an object. Pay attention to these alerts but do not rely solely on them.\n• 360-degree cameras: Some vehicles offer a 360-degree view, which can provide a better overall perspective. Use this feature to enhance your situational awareness.\n• Blind spot monitoring: Utilize any blind spot monitoring systems to assist in detecting vehicles or objects that you might not see when backing up.\nBy combining these technologies with proper visual search patterns and cautious driving, you can significantly reduce the risk of collisions while backing up. Remember, technology is there to assist you, but your primary focus should always be on visually confirming your surroundings and backing up safely."

Palming (precision backing technique)\n   Palming is an advanced steering technique that’s only used when backing. It’s used in situations where both straight line backing and sharp turning are required. This method allows you to turn the wheel sharply while ensuring that your front wheels will be straight when your hand is at 12 o’clock. Put your left hand at the 12 o’clock position but do not grasp the wheel. Instead, push your palm against the rim of the wheel with enough pressure so that when you move your hand down and around, the wheel turns, but your palm stays on the same place on the wheel rim."

      "content": "Using time to estimate when you can pass is complicated, but it’s well worth the effort required to master it. You can practise passing safely and once you can judge time well, you have a good method of judging when it’s safe to pass.\n\nYou can get all the information you need to make a passing judgment from two estimates: the estimate of your safe passing time and the estimate of the closing time between you and the approaching vehicle.\n\nThe first step in developing your new technique is to find out how long it normally takes you to pass. This varies from 10 to 40 seconds depending on your vehicle, your technique and the difference in speed between you and the vehicle you are passing. To find your safe passing time, choose a divided highway or a two-way highway at a time and place when traffic is light.\n\nFirst, determine your passing time as follows:\n1. Follow the vehicle ahead at the same speed, but three seconds back. Note its speed.\n2. Check that you can see at least 40 seconds ahead, that there are no vehicles coming the other way and that there are no intersections or solid lane markings.\n3. Begin counting “Thou - sand one, Thou - sand two” from the point you decide to pass and begin to accelerate.\n4. Signal, and at a point where you still have good vision and can smoothly change lanes around the vehicle ahead, move into the left lane.\n5. Continue in the left lane until you see the vehicle you have just passed in your inside mirror. As you pull back into your original lane, signal right and continue your acceleration. Do not decelerate as you change lanes.\n6. Continue counting until you have completed your pass. Stop your count when your left rear wheel crosses the lane line (just as you are returning to your original lane in front of the vehicle you have passed).\n7. The last number you say after “Thou - sand” is your measure of passing time in seconds.\n\nNext, build in a safety margin that you are comfortable with.\n\nFive seconds is a minimum safety margin. For example, if your passing time is 15 seconds, add another five seconds for possible error. This will give you a cushion of five seconds if the vehicle coming towards you is approaching faster than normal or if your estimation is not accurate."

Determine the point at which you could safely return to your lane if you were to pass the vehicle in front – the safe return point. For example, watch a vehicle pass and note where it pulls back into the driving lane.\n3. When an approaching vehicle appears, start counting and continue counting until the vehicle reaches the safe return point ahead of you.

When a vehicle is approaching, decide if it is safe to pass or not. Say “safe” or “unsafe,” then count “Thou - sand one, Thou - sand two” – check the actual closing time against your safe passing time to see if you were right. Keep practising until you can make the safe/unsafe judgment with 100% accuracy.\n\nThere are two advantages to practising your passing judgment in this way. First, it is completely safe because you never actually pass the vehicle. Second, your timing will be based on the actual speeds of vehicles using the highway.\n\nBe sure to keep the type and size of vehicle you are passing in mind. For instance, when passing a motorcycle make sure you leave a greater distance between your vehicle and the motorcycle you are passing, before pulling back into the driving lane. It’s easy to underestimate how much room you should allow due to the smaller size of a motorcycle."

      "title": "Driving on slippery surfaces",
      "content": "Winter traction problems require a number of changes from summer driving techniques. The general rule for driving on slippery conditions is drive slowly. You should not use cruise control on icy or slippery roads. This is even more important when the road may have black ice formed on it (a thin layer of transparent ice found on the road or other paved surfaces). Traction varies tremendously with temperature changes. Icy roads will look just the same at -2 C or -22 C, but will be far more slippery at the warmer temperature. Winter driving calls for special driving skills. This means gentle acceleration, gentle braking and small, smooth steering movements. Reduced traction means the grip between your tires and the slippery surface is fragile. If you accelerate hard, you go beyond the amount of traction that is available and your wheels spin. If you brake too hard and your wheels lock, you break the traction, which means that when you turn the steering wheel, the vehicle will not turn – it will continue in the direction it was going when the wheels locked. If this occurs on ice, your stopping distance changes. In most situations, locking four wheels by pushing hard on the brakes will give you the shortest stopping distance. But on ice, especially when it’s near the freezing point or if you are driving fast, you are better off to threshold-brake by pushing on the brake up to the point just before it locks. If the surface is slippery, flatten the corner or curve by positioning your vehicle in the left side of your lane prior to making your turn. As you enter the curve, gradually steer across the lane so that as you near the midpoint of the curve the vehicle is near the right side of the lane with its wheels straight. As you exit the curve, gradually steer back across the lane towards the left side. For left curves, reverse the process. This will lessen the sideways force and reduce the chance that you will spin out. Slow entry into the curve is crucial or your vehicle may not make it around the curve. Because there is reduced traction available for stopping and turning, reduce your speed when conditions are wet or slippery. As well, give yourself a following distance even longer than three seconds. Never use cruise control when roads are wet or slippery."

When your wheels spin, immediately stop accelerating and hold the vehicle with the brake to stop it from rolling back. Shift to reverse, release the brake and accelerate gently. You will move back. When the wheels spin again, stop immediately. Repeat the forward-backward rocking movement, increasing the distance you move each time until you gain sufficient momentum to keep moving ahead. Be sure the wheels have stopped turning before changing gears to avoid damage to your transmission. Search for traction. Look for sand or grit. Choose snow rather than ice.

Run the engine to get some heat, and to listen to news reports or charge your cellphone but don’t run out of gas or drain your battery.\n5. Keep your exhaust pipe clear of ice and snow.\n6. Get into your emergency clothing before you get cold.\n7. If necessary, use candles to keep warm. Be careful not to over-exert yourself by shovelling or by pushing your vehicle. Many people die when they leave their vehicles to walk for help in a blizzard. If you stay with your vehicle, you have a better chance of surviving and are more likely to be found."

  "title": "Braking",
  "content": "The general procedure for braking is to begin early, apply light pressure and ease up on the brake as the vehicle comes to a stop. Always brake with your right foot. If you want to stop more quickly, push the brake down a little further. Remember, for normal braking you control the stop by varying the pressure. Do not push the brake down as far as it will go. Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) – was introduced in the mid-1980s and has become standard equipment on most newer vehicles. It was designed to help drivers maintain some steering ability and avoid skidding while braking. In normal braking, ABS is not activated. During hard braking, vehicles with ABS remain stable. The brakes do not lock up, which means the driver has more steering control. How do you use ABS? Press the brake firmly and do not release until the vehicle has stopped. Do not pump your brakes; the ABS is doing it for you. When the ABS is active, the brake pedal may pulsate and the car may shudder or emit clunking noises. This can startle some drivers, causing them to release the brake, but these things are normal and indicate the ABS is functioning properly. You may think that with ABS you can stop on a dime. This instantaneous stop is not realistic. When braking on dry or wet roads your stopping distance will be about the same as with conventional brakes. You should allow for a longer stopping distance with ABS than with conventional brakes when driving on gravel, slush and snow. This is because the rotating tire will stay on top of this low-traction road surface covering and effectively float on this layer. A non-ABS-braked vehicle can lock its tires and create a snow plow effect in front of the tires that may, in some cases, help slow the vehicle. These locked tires can sometimes find more traction below this layer. It’s recommended you refer to your vehicle owner’s manual to become familiar with proper practices should your vehicle have electronic stability control, traction control, or other safety features.",

      "title": "Threshold braking",
      "content": "In threshold braking, you’re trying to use all the braking force available without locking the wheels, i.e., you’re trying for the threshold just before lock-up. To accomplish this, shift to neutral (declutch) and brake until you feel one or more wheels lock, then, ease up the brake slightly until the wheels are all rolling again. Re-apply pressure until you feel one of the wheels start to lock up, ease off slightly and continue this movement, tracking the threshold until you stop. As the vehicle slows, you can brake harder before lock-up will occur. The more slippery the surface, the less you will be able to push the brake before a wheel locks. The skill in threshold braking comes from being able to linger just short of lock-up. To threshold brake well requires much effort and concentration. While it’s usually the technique of choice, it is almost impossible to do if you panic."

      "title": "Four-wheel lock braking",
      "content": "With this technique, you shift to neutral (declutch) and then hit the brakes very hard so that all four wheels lock at the same time. Since most cars aren’t designed to do this, you need to stomp on the brake pedal and keep maximum pressure on the brake until you come to a complete stop. Your vehicle will travel in a straight line. If all four wheels do not lock at exactly the same time, or if the surface under different tires varies, the vehicle may rotate a little before it finally stops. Even under the worst conditions (one wheel on ice, one wheel on dry pavement), the vehicle will travel in a straight line, although it may revolve around a point in the middle of the vehicle. You need very little pressure to lock the wheels on ice. As the traction increases, you must increase the pressure to lock the wheels. On dry pavement, you really have to stomp on the brake to lock all four wheels simultaneously. You must also be seated sufficiently close to the brake pedal to get the leverage required. The four-wheel lock will produce the shortest stopping distance on all surfaces, except glare ice. It’s also an ideal technique to use if you panic because stomping on the brake is a natural reaction. Also, once you stamp on the brake, you do not have to do anything except keep pressure on the brake. If possible, try the four-wheel lock when you are with a trained instructor. Otherwise, practise at low speeds (20 - 40 km/h) on a wet surface. If you try this procedure on dry pavement, you may damage your tires, which is acceptable if you’re trying to avoid a crash, but not recommended if you are just practising."

      "content": "The difference between steering in an emergency situation and steering in a normal driving situation is the speed and amount that you need to turn the wheel. If you do skid and need to recover, turn the wheel to correct your direction of travel. This method just takes practise. The difficult part is knowing when your wheels are straight. At higher speeds, use the “9 and 3” steering method. Twist the wheel without moving your hands on the wheel. When your hands return to 9 and 3, you know your front wheels are straight. Steering around an object involves three movements: Steer – Twist the wheel in the direction you wish to go. Counter-steer – Turn the wheel back the other way beyond the centrepoint. Straighten out – Twist the wheel back to the point where your wheels are straight. Timing is crucial, so it’s advisable to practise this manoeuvre with an experienced instructor. It’s important, after turning around an obstacle, to get the vehicle going straight before you begin a second steering movement. If your choice is between braking or steering, choose to steer. You can steer around an obstacle in a shorter distance than it takes to stop in front of it."

Regardless of the method of braking you use, take your foot off the brake to steer around the object. Most importantly, do one thing at a time, either brake or steer. If your wheels are locked, the car will go straight ahead regardless of how you turn the steering wheel.

It’s a simple procedure as long as you don’t steer very much. You should, however, grip the wheel tightly.

To drive down the ditch, hold the wheel firmly. Look and steer gently down the slope to where you want to go. Stay off the brake. Gradually release the accelerator. If you need to steer to avoid an obstacle, do it slowly and gradually and, if you have a choice, choose the direction that will send you down the slope. If you suddenly find yourself going into a ditch, do not over-react. Try to resist doing anything until you think about what you must do. You’re better off to do nothing than to try the wrong thing. It’s perfectly all right to drive in a ditch to avoid a rollover, provided you don’t hit an approach road or something hard. The main cause of rollovers is attempting to return to the road too early.

Blood alcohol content (BAC) may be affected\n    by age, gender, physical condition, and amount of food consumed, medication and\n    other factors. Also, different mixed drinks contain different amounts of alcohol, so it’s\n    important to know how much alcohol has been consumed, not just how many drinks\n    the person has had.\n\n    Sequence of effects on the body\n    Alcohol is absorbed into the blood stream very quickly. As blood alcohol levels start to\n    rise, the brain becomes increasingly sedated or drugged.\n\n    1. Judgment                                  2.   Muscle control\n       The ﬁrst part of the body affected             The second part of the body affected\n       by alcohol is the brain, particularly          by alcohol is muscle control. Due to\n       the part of the brain that allows              the small muscles in the eye being\n       you to think clearly and make good             very susceptible to the effects of\n       decisions.

The part of the\n       brain that controls social inhibitions is\n       also affected, causing people to say\n       and do things they normally would\n       not. These effects start with one drink.\n\n    Many people wrongly assess their ability to drive after drinking by observing physical\n    dexterity (staggering, etc.). This is incorrect as the greatest percentage of alcohol-\n    related collisions result from faulty thinking during the identiﬁcation, prediction and\n    decision parts of the driving task and not as a result of poor execution (steering,\n    braking, etc.).\n\n\n Drinking, drugs and driving\n7.1 Alcohol\nThe brain functions that are ﬁrst affected by alcohol consumption are not only\nimportant to our ability to drive safely, but are the same ones required to make rational\ndecisions about not driving after drinking. For this reason, you must make the decision\nto separate your drinking and driving and make the necessary alternate transportation\nplans before you have that ﬁrst drink!\n\nIt doesn’t make sense to drive after drinking.

It can also cause paranoia,\ndrowsiness, distorted perception and a\nsense of disorientation – all of which could\ncause you to lose control at the wheel.\n\nSome experts claim that smoking a cannabis joint has roughly a similar level of\nimpairment on driving ability as drinking four pints of beer. Also, reports show that in\nthe majority of fatal collisions where cannabis has been detected in a driver’s body,\nalcohol has also been detected. Alcohol alone or in combination with cannabis\nincreases impairment, collision rate and collision responsibility (the same can be\napplied to other drugs too).\n\nDepressant drugs\nLike alcohol, other depressant drugs include sedatives\nor tranquillizers (used to treat anxiety, depression and\nsleeping disorders, e.g., valium), antihistamines (often\nused in ﬂu, allergy and hay fever remedies) and painkillers.\nThese drugs slow down your brain and body; they blunt\nalertness and reduce motor coordination. This affects a\nperson’s ability to drive safely in a way similar to alcohol.\nAny drug that causes drowsiness can also affect a\nperson’s ability to drive safely.\n\n\n\n\n 7     Drinking, drugs and driving\n      7.2 Drugs\n\n\n\n    People who drive after using any type of depressant can’t react as quickly when they\n    need to. Their vision is affected, and may be blurred or doubled. Depth perception is\n    altered, making it hard to tell whether other vehicles, pedestrians or objects are close\n    or far away. Their driving is more likely to be careless or reckless – weaving, speeding,\n    driving off the road, and (too often) crashing.\n\n    If the label advises against operating heavy machinery, consider it a warning not to get\n    behind the wheel of a vehicle.\n\n    Stimulants\n    Stimulant drugs, such as caffeine and amphetamines, may increase alertness, but this\n    does not mean they improve driving skills. The tired driver who drinks coffee to stay\n    awake on the road should be aware that the stimulant effect can wear off suddenly,\n    and that the only remedy for fatigue is to pull off the road and sleep. Amphetamines\n    do not seem to affect driving skills when taken at medical doses, but they do make\n    some people over-conﬁdent, which can lead to risky driving. Higher doses of\n    amphetamines often make people hostile and aggressive.\n\n    If you think drug taking has little, or even a positive impact on your driving, you could\n    be tragically mistaken. It’s important to bear in mind that it can be hard to determine\n    exactly how a drug will affect your driving ability – impairment caused by drugs can\n    vary according to the individual, drug type, dosage, the length of time the drug stays\n    in your body, or if the drug has been taken with other drugs or alcohol.\n\n    When taking prescription or over-the-counter medications, it’s wise to consult with\n    your doctor or pharmacist before driving.\n\n\n\n\n Drinking, drugs and driving\n7.2 Drugs",

Assume that a drink is:\n    • 1 bottle of regular alcohol content beer; or\n    • 5 ounces table wine; or\n    • 3 ounces fortiﬁed wine (port or sherry); or\n    • 1-1/2 ounce hard liquor (rye, rum, vodka etc.).\n\n    Combined with:\n    • anti-depressants\n    • gravol\n    • antihistamines\n    • valium\n\n\n\n\n Drinking, drugs and driving\nWe ﬁnd that there is a predictable synergistic effect related to the level of impairment\ncaused by a certain number of drinks when combined in this manner.\n\n   Number of                                                   Equivalent to Number\n                                  Combined With\n    Drinks                                                           of Drinks\n        2                 Antihistamine (Cold Remedy)              = 4 to 5\n        2                         Marijuana (1 joint)              = 5 to 6\n        2               Tranquilizer (Valium – normal dose)        = Approximately 6\n        2                              Gravol                      = Approximately 6\n\nIt must be noted that the dosage of the drug will have a serious effect on the\n“equivalence to number of drinks” estimates. Hydroponically grown marijuana, for\nexample, is much stronger than the light dosage drug used in compiling the ﬁgures for\nthis chart.\n\nIn all cases, the Intoxilyzer reading would indicate just the blood alcohol level caused\nby two drinks, but the actual impairment of central nervous system function would be\nequivalent to a much higher blood alcohol level.\n\nUnderstanding the synergistic effect of alcohol combined with other drugs could be a\nlifesaver.\n",

If you’re charged and\n    convicted of a criminal negligence causing bodily harm, the penalties are increased.\n\n    Dangerous driving\n    Failing to exercise reasonable care in the operation of a motor vehicle is an offence.\n\n    Failure to stop at scene of collision\n    If you’re involved in a collision with a person, vehicle or cattle in the charge of a\n    person, you must give your name, address, driver’s licence number and insurance\n    information to any other involved people and assist any injured people.\n\n    Drive while disqualiﬁed\n    If you drive while you’re disqualiﬁed, you could face additional charges, vehicle\n    impoundment, and other ﬁnancial consequences. It’s an offence under the Criminal\n    Code to drive while disqualiﬁed.\n\n    Arrest\n    You may be arrested if you:\n    • operate an unregistered vehicle\n    • drive without a driver’s licence\n    • fail to stop when signalled by police\n    • drive without care and attention or without reasonable consideration for others\n    • tamper with a vehicle\n    • fail to provide information when requested by police\n    • commit Criminal Code offences\n\n    You may be arrested if the police have reason to believe you will not appear in court to\n    answer your summons.\n\n    Licence disqualiﬁcations\n    If you’re convicted of any of the offences                    One conviction        1 year\n    discussed in this section, your licence will be               Two convictions       3 years\n    automatically cancelled and you will be disqualiﬁed           Three convictions     5 years\n    from driving. The period of disqualiﬁcation will be\n    based on the number of Criminal Code convictions\n    you have had in the last 10 years.\n    In addition to these automatic provincial disqualiﬁcations, the court may issue an order\n    prohibiting you from operating a motor vehicle on any street, road, highway or other\n    public place anywhere in Canada for a period of time. You will not be allowed issue of\n    a full unrestricted driver’s licence until the expiration of the longer period, whether it is\n    the automatic disqualiﬁcation or the court order.\n\n\n\n\n Complying with the law when driving\n8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada\nReinstatement of driving privileges\nIf you’re convicted of a criminal offence you may be eligible for early reinstatement of\nyour driving privileges. Options for early reinstatement may include:\n• ignition interlock special restricted driver’s licence\n• special restricted driver’s licence\n\nThese options are issued on the provision that you have a zero tolerance for drugs\nand alcohol while driving. This means no detectable amount of alcohol or drugs in\nyour system.\n\nIgnition interlock special restricted driver’s licence\nThe Ignition Interlock program is a remedial program for drivers who have received\nimpaired driving suspensions or convictions. An ignition interlock device prevents\nyou from operating a vehicle if you have alcohol in your body. A device is installed in\nthe vehicle that is connected to the vehicle’s ignition that checks for the presence\nof alcohol in the driver. The driver must blow into the machine to start the car, and\ncontinue to periodically blow into the device to keep the car in motion. If the device\nsenses alcohol, the car will not start. If while in motion the device senses alcohol the\nhorn will start honking and headlights will ﬂash to draw attention to the vehicle. These\ncannot be stopped until the vehicle is turned off.\n\nThe ignition interlock special restricted licence is mandatory for the following:\n• Your conviction was for impaired driving, driving while equal to or over the legal limit for\n  alcohol or a combination of alcohol and drugs, or for failing to comply with a demand.\n• You received a third roadside suspension within the last 10 years and it’s alcohol-\n  related. (Note: If you received your ﬁrst two roadside licence suspensions as a new\n  driver, those count towards the number of offences as an experienced driver.)\n\nThe ignition interlock special restricted licence is voluntary for the following:\n• You received a second roadside licence suspension as a new driver within the last\n  10 years.\n• You received an indeﬁnite roadside administrative suspension for an alcohol-related\n  Criminal Code offence and you’ve served at least 90 days of your suspension.\n\nThe device must remain in the vehicle until the ignition interlock suspension period\nends. You cannot wait out your suspension period.\n\nEligibility and program duration\nThe Ignition Interlock program is mandatory for certain impaired driving offences, the\nlength of the mandatory term depends on how many prior offences the driver has in\nthe past 10 years, and the type of impaired driving offence.\n\n\n\n\n 8     Complying with the law when driving\n      8.2 The Criminal Code of Canada • 8.3 Trafﬁc tickets\n\n\n\n    You’re not eligible for early reinstatement of your driving privileges by installing an\n    ignition interlock device if you’ve been declared ineligible by a judge, your conviction\n    is not alcohol-related, or because you’ve been convicted under the Criminal Code of\n    Canada for any impaired driving offence causing bodily injury or death.\n\n    Special restricted driver’s licence\n    A restricted driver’s licence limits when and where you can drive. You may be granted\n    a restricted licence if you demonstrate that:\n    • the licence suspension would cause you exceptional hardship\n    • allowing for a restricted licence would not be contrary to public interest\n\n    You’re eligible to apply to the Highway Trafﬁc Board for a special restricted licence if\n    the following applies to you:\n    • Your conviction is non-alcohol/drug related and you have served the entire court-\n      ordered prohibition period and completed the required educational program.\n    • Your conviction is alcohol/drug related and you have completed the required\n      educational program and your mandatory ignition interlock term, and still must serve\n      the provincial suspension.\n    • You paid the $75 reinstatement fee.\n\n\n    8.3 Trafﬁc tickets\n    When the police charge you with a violation, they’ll issue a ticket indicating the\n    offence you committed as well as the date, time and location. The ticket will also\n    indicate where and when you are to appear in court. Some tickets, including those for\n    stunting, racing and driving at excessive speeds, will result in an immediate roadside\n    suspension.\n\n    For some less serious offences, the ticket will indicate the amount of the ﬁne you must\n    pay. If you choose to plead guilty, you may pay your ﬁne voluntarily through the mail or\n    online, if available.\n\n    You must appear in court to enter a not guilty plea. You’ll then have a trial date set.\n    You may want to consult a lawyer before entering a plea.\n\n\n\n\n Complying with the law when driving\n8.4 Driver Improvement Program\n8.4 Driver Improvement Program\nThe Driver Improvement Program monitors the driving records of all Saskatchewan\ndrivers. The program aims to make Saskatchewan roads safer for everyone by\nreducing the incidence of high-risk behaviours by motorists.\n\nImpaired driving is one example of high-risk driving, but many motorists endanger\nthe lives of others through behaviours that frequently cause motor vehicle collisions,\nincluding speeding, running red lights and stunting.\n\nUnder this program, drivers are assigned points every time they are convicted of a\ntrafﬁc offence or have an at-fault collision. Drivers who reach their maximum threshold\nof points are sent a warning letter to advise that tougher sanctions will follow should\ntheir driving record continue to deteriorate.\n\nDrivers who continue their high-risk behaviour face consequences that include ﬁnes,\ndriver’s licence re-testing, driver’s licence suspensions of up to six months and\ncompletion of a driver improvement training program.\n\nFor more information on the Driver Improvement Program, call 1-844-TLK-2SGI\n(1-844-855-2744).\n\n                                 Penalty                             Demerit points\n\n Program information letter                                        9 or more points\n Warning letter                                                    12 or more points\n Defensive Driving Course                                          15 or more points\n Driver Improvement Training                                       18 or more points\n 30-day suspension                                                 21 or more points\n 90-day suspension                                                 24 or more points\n 180-day suspension                                                27 or more points\n Driver Improvement interview and penalty                          30 or more points\n SGI manual review and penalty                                     33 or more points\n\n\n\n\n 8       Complying with the law when driving\n\n\n\n    The Safe Driver Recognition (SDR) program rewards safe drivers with a discount on\n    their vehicle insurance.\n\n    If you own or lease a vehicle registered in Class LV, PV or F (one ton model or\n    smaller), you may be eligible to receive a discount on your vehicle insurance premium.\n    That discount will apply to every qualifying vehicle you insure.\n\n    On the other hand, the program also ensures drivers who demonstrate risky behaviour\n    pay their share in ﬁnancial penalties - helping offset the costs of the discount for safe\n    drivers.\n",

            "content": "The Safety Zone – Discounts\nFor every year since 1995 that you have driven without an incident, you earn a safety\npoint. Each point in the Safety Zone corresponds to a discount on your vehicle plate\ninsurance, to a maximum of 25%.\n\nEven if you don’t own a vehicle, a positive rating in the Safety Zone is beneﬁcial to\nyou. It protects all safe drivers from ﬁnancial penalties if they are involved in future\nincidents.\n\nYou only receive a ﬁnancial penalty for an incident if it causes you to lose enough\npoints to move you to the Penalty Zone on the scale. As long as you remain in the\nSafety Zone, you continue to receive some level of discount.\n\nYou’re eligible for a Safe Driver Recognition discount on your registered motorcycle\nplates, if you get:\n• To the Novice 2 stage of the Motorcycle Graduated Driver Licensing program and\n  take an SGI -approved motorcycle training course, or\n• Your full M Endorsement.\n\n3 discount zones\n• Good Drivers Zone (+1 to +10) - If you’re in the Good Drivers Zone, you have\n  earned enough safety rating points to receive a discount on your basic vehicle\n  insurance. For each year you drive incident-free, you earn a safety rating point that\n  gives you 2% off your basic vehicle insurance.\n• Great Drivers Zone (+11 to +20) - If you’re in the Great Drivers Zone, you have\n  earned enough safety rating points to receive a 20% discount on your basic vehicle\n  insurance, plus you have earned a cushion to shield you from losing some or all of\n  your discount if you cause a collision or get trafﬁc convictions in the future.\n• Safest Drivers Zone (+21 to +25) - If you’re in the Safest Drivers Zone, you have\n  driven incident-free for more than 20 years. You earn an extra 1% discount for each\n  additional year you drive incident-free up to a maximum discount of 25%.\n\nThe Penalty Zone – Financial penalties\nDrivers lose points for unsafe driving - such as being at fault for a collision or certain\ntrafﬁc convictions and roadside suspensions. Driving disqualiﬁcations automatically\nmove drivers to -20 or lower, regardless of where they were on the scale prior.\n\nFinancial penalties are assessed for incidents that result in a safety rating below zero.\n• You’re assessed a ﬁnancial penalty of $50 for each point you move in the Penalty\n  Zone (capped at a maximum penalty of $1,000).\n• The further an incident moves you into the Penalty Zone, the more you pay for that\n  incident. The maximum penalty noted above applies to most incidents, with the\n  exception of certain Criminal Code convictions.

Depending on your driving habits\nand how often you drive, these basic techniques and useful tips could save you\nhundreds of dollars a year in fuel and maintenance costs:\n\n• It’s both safer and more fuel efﬁcient to maintain a steady speed on a road.\n  Accelerate smoothly when passing or merging with faster trafﬁc and avoid hard\n  braking. European tests have shown that aggressive driving, including frequent rapid\n  acceleration and hard braking, can increase fuel consumption by approximately\n  40%.\n• Drive at the posted speed limit. Lowering your highway cruising speed from\n  120 km/h to 100 km/h will reduce fuel consumption by up to 20%.\n• Plan your trips to combine errands and to avoid trafﬁc jams, steep hills, road\n  construction, etc. Combining a number of short trips into one longer one allows your\n  engine and drivetrain to reach peak operating temperature, which is not possible on\n  trips of less than 5 km. Avoiding trouble spots shortens your travel time and reduces\n  unnecessary idling.\n• If you are driving a vehicle with a manual transmission, learn how to use it properly\n  for maximum fuel savings. A tachometer can help you shift the transmission at the\n  most fuel-efﬁcient engine speeds (the owner’s manual will indicate these speeds).\n• If you have cruise control, use it for highway driving to maintain a constant speed.\n  The exception is on hilly terrain, where it’s a good idea to allow the vehicle’s speed\n  to drop slightly going uphill and then let gravity help you build up speed again (to a\n  safe level) going down the other side.\n• In summer, minimize your use of air conditioning. Operating an air conditioner in\n  hot weather can increase fuel consumption by more than 20% in city driving.\n  A more fuel-efﬁcient option for staying cool is to open a window. However, at\n  highway speeds, use your car’s ﬂow-through ventilation – open windows and\n  sunroofs increase aerodynamic drag, which makes the engine work harder and\n  consume more fuel. If you must use your vehicle’s air conditioning, avoid running\n  it continuously. Shut it off after the interior is cool or set the controls to a comfort\n  level that allows the system to cycle.\n• Check tire pressure at least once a month when the tires are cold (i.e., the vehicle\n  has been stationary for at least three hours or has not been driven more than 2 km).\n  If you have to drive more than 2 km to add air, check the tires before you leave and\n  then add the amount of air that is missing from this reading. Inﬂate the tires to the\n  recommended pressure, usually indicated on the car door, glove compartment or\n  in the owner’s manual. With proper tire inﬂation, your car will burn less fuel and\n  be safer to drive. A vehicle with tires that are under-inﬂated by a total of 10 psi\n  increases fuel consumption by 5%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n• Use a block heater in the winter to warm the engine oil and make cold starts easier\n  on your engine components. Your vehicle’s oil doesn’t freeze when the temperature\n  dips below 0˚C, but it does get much thicker. This means your engine has to work\n  harder and use more fuel. Use a timer to switch the block heater on two hours\n  before you plan to drive. Proper use of a block heater can improve your vehicle’s\n  overall fuel economy by as much as 10%. Still, don’t leave your block heater on\n  overnight or your energy savings will disappear in a higher electricity bill.\n• Follow the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended operating procedures and\n  maintenance schedule in your owner’s manual. Regular maintenance such as oil and\n  ﬁlter changes will not only prevent early degeneration of your vehicle’s components,\n  it will also keep them operating at their most fuel-efﬁcient level. A clogged air\n  ﬁlter can increase fuel consumption by up to 10%. Regular maintenance will keep\n  your vehicle operating safely, save you money and, at the same time, help the\n  environment.\n• Remote car starters are handy on cold winter mornings, but don’t start your car\n  too soon. In most driving conditions, today’s modern engines need less warm-up\n  time even on cold mornings. Also, allowing your car to idle too long wastes gas and\n  produces unnecessary exhaust emissions.\n• Idling for more than 10 seconds, except in trafﬁc, wastes more fuel than stopping\n  your engine and restarting again. At the end of the day, stopping unnecessary idling\n  will beneﬁt the environment and save you money.\n ",
