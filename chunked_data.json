    "content": "1. Introduction Thanks for picking up the Saskatchewan Driver’s Handbook!  Driver training is a rite of passage many of us share. Now that the time has come to get your driver’s licence, SGI wants to help you get ready. We created this handbook to teach you the basics, like: • trafﬁc signs and signals • the rules of the road • driving in different weather conditions, like snow, rain and fog • sharing the road with other vehicles, pedestrians and bicyclists  The handbook also covers advanced skills, like how to predict what other drivers might do, and then how to respond in the moment.  A handy resource for new and experienced drivers alike, study this book before your test and keep consulting it even after you get your licence. It can help you pass your driver’s test and lay the groundwork for decades of safe driving.  If we could offer one piece of advice, it’s to get as much practice as you can with your supervising driver. The conﬁdence gained from hands-on experience behind the wheel will help you when it’s time for your road test.  Good luck on your path to becoming a great driver.  We’ll see you on the road!    ",

    "content": " 2. Saskatchewan\u2019s driver\u2019s licence program Driver programs and examinations are designed to develop safe and capable drivers who know and understand the rules of the road. Driving is a responsibility and a privilege. It\u2019s not a right. Provincial regulations exist to meet safety needs as well as promote the efficient and safe flow of traffic.  To drive in Saskatchewan you must hold a valid driver\u2019s licence for the type of vehicle you wish to operate. The classified driver\u2018s licence system establishes minimum standards of skill, knowledge, physical and mental fitness for the safe operation of different types of vehicles. Drivers are then licensed accordingly.  The first time you apply for a Saskatchewan driver\u2019s licence, you\u2019ll be asked to provide documents to prove your identity, proof of residency and entitlement to be in Canada. Each document must be from an authority such as a federal or provincial government or a federal agency (a full list of approved documents can be found at sgi.sk.ca/identity-and-residency-verification and in SGI\u2019s Establishing Your Identity pamphlet). They must also be originals, not photocopies. Electronic scans of these documents may be kept on file, in keeping with Canadian standards.  To get a driver\u2019s licence, you must be able to operate a vehicle safely and properly, understand all traffic signs and know the rules of the road. You\u2019re required to complete a driver\u2019s examination if you: \u2022 Have never been a licensed driver; \u2022 Have not held a Saskatchewan driver\u2019s licence or specific Class or Endorsement within the past five years; \u2022 Wish to become a certified driver instructor in Saskatchewan; \u2022 Want to change the class of your licence or obtain an endorsement; or \u2022 Are a new resident, and the licence you hold is from another province, state or country not honoured or recognized in Saskatchewan. Licences may be honoured from the United States. Licences from Germany, Switzerland, South Korea, the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland, Isle of Man, Australia, Austria, Belgium, France, Japan, Jersey, Netherlands, New Zealand, Ukraine and Taiwan may be exchanged for a Saskatchewan Class 5 driver\u2019s licence and motorcycle endorsement, where applicable. Saskatchewan may also accept a driver\u2019s licence from a country not listed. Please check with any Saskatchewan motor licence issuer, driver examination office, or visit www.sgi.sk.ca/newresidents or contact us toll free at 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744). The nine-month learning period and driver training requirement may be waived if you can prove past driving experience by providing a valid driver\u2019s licence, written in English or French, or a valid licence in another language accompanied by a translation document acceptable to SGI (i.e. International Driving Permit).  If you\u2019re a new resident wanting a Saskatchewan driver\u2019s licence without being tested, you must meet some requirements: \u2022 If you\u2019re a former resident of a Canadian province or territory you must have a valid driver\u2019s licence from that jurisdiction. An expired driver\u2019s licence (not older than five years) from that jurisdiction is also acceptable. New residents may drive with their valid out-of-province driver\u2019s licence for 90 days after moving to Saskatchewan. ",

        "title": "Vehicle registration",
        "content": "All vehicles must be properly registered according to purpose and must display the appropriate licence plate.  Licence plates must be securely attached and clearly visible. That means plates must not be obstructed in a way that prevents them from being read or accurately photographed by any enforcement system.  The number or identity of the licence plate must not be altered or changed in any way.  If you're a new resident you have up to 90 days to register your vehicle in Saskatchewan. Basic insurance coverage is required. A non-resident (someone who does not own, rent or lease a residence in Saskatchewan and, if required, does not pay Saskatchewan income tax) may drive in Saskatchewan indefinitely providing your out-of-province or out-of-country driver's licence remains valid.  How auto insurance works in Saskatchewan  Saskatchewan auto insurance comes in two parts:  Basic minimum coverage – Is required by law and is purchased at the same time you pay for your licence plates and vehicle registration. This coverage is compulsory and is provided by SGI.  Additional coverage – Sometimes referred to as extended auto insurance, a package policy or an Auto Pak, additional coverage is tailored to your needs and is provided on a separate auto insurance policy. This important protection may be purchased from the insurance company, broker or agent of your choice.  Licence plate insurance coverage  Your licence plate carries basic insurance coverage in three areas:  Collision and comprehensive – Coverage for damage to your vehicle, subject to a deductible.  Personal injury – Benefits for personal injury resulting from a vehicle collision.  Liability – Insurance for damage your vehicle causes to another vehicle or property, or injury to others.  Collision and comprehensive is also known as physical damage coverage. It pays for damage to your vehicle due to a collision or other occurrence such as hail, fire or theft.*  Personal injury benefits provide Saskatchewan residents with injury and death benefits if they are injured or killed in an automobile collision anywhere in Canada or the United States. All Saskatchewan residents have a choice between two equally priced auto injury coverages – No Fault Coverage and Tort Coverage.  * Most vehicles are covered to the actual cash value, which is the market value of your vehicle compared with similar vehicles, with similar equipment, mileage and condition to the insured vehicle (see Coverage Limitations referenced in the Driver’s Licence and Basic Insurance brochure).   Liability coverage protects you as a vehicle owner and driver if you and/or your  vehicle are responsible for injuries caused to others or damage to property belonging  to others. \u2018Others\u2019 may be another motorist, a pedestrian or bicyclist, a passenger in  your vehicle, or the owner of property you damage.  To be liable is to be at fault and responsible for damage or injury. You can be  liable whether you choose No Fault or Tort injury (all Saskatchewan residents are  automatically covered with No Fault injury coverage unless they choose Tort injury  coverage and file a declaration form). Liability coverage will pay the cost to defend  you if someone claims you are liable, as well as the damages if you are found  responsible.  Plate insurance provides up to $200,000 in liability coverage. Although  compensation for many injuries and damages is covered under the collision  and comprehensive coverage or the personal injury benefits, there are also many  situations where compensation will be based on who is at fault, what happened and  where it happened (for instance, if you were driving in the U.S. or another Canadian  province). These include damage to buildings or fences near a street, to cargo in a  vehicle you collide with, or to trains, cargo, and tracks at a level crossing, including  environmental damage. If you\u2019re responsible for an injury or death in Saskatchewan of  someone whose earnings were greater than the personal injury benefit amount, or to  anyone out of province, you will likely have a liability claim.  No Fault Coverage Saskatchewan residents with No Fault Coverage receive a comprehensive package  of benefits regardless of the circumstances of the collision. Benefits include coverage  for income loss, medical and rehabilitation expenses, permanent impairment and  death benefits. Those with No Fault Coverage can sue for certain expenses not  covered by their benefits, as well as for income loss which exceeds the benefits  provided by the plan. Except in very limited circumstances, they cannot sue for pain  and suffering.  Tort Coverage Saskatchewan residents with Tort Coverage receive a basic package of benefits  regardless of the circumstances of the collision. Benefits include some coverage for  income loss, medical and rehabilitation expenses, permanent impairment and death  benefits. Those with Tort Coverage who are not totally at fault for the collision can  sue for expenses and income losses not covered by their benefits and for pain and  suffering, subject to a $5,000 deductible.  For more information on No Fault Coverage, Tort Coverage or how to choose your  auto injury insurance, visit [www.sgi.sk.ca](https://www.sgi.sk.ca) or ask any SGI office or SGI motor licence  issuing office for informational materials that explain the coverages.  Your vehicle deductible Your plate insurance covers loss of, or damage to, your vehicle and its equipment  from causes such as a collision, upset, fire, theft, windstorm or hail. Subject to your  deductible.  A deductible is applicable to any vehicle loss you may have. It\u2019s the amount you  are required to pay before your licence plate insurance benefits begin to cover the  remaining costs.  For example, if your deductible is $700 and you\u2019re responsible for a collision which  causes $2,000 worth of damage to your vehicle, then SGI will pay for damage in  excess of your deductible. You\u2019ll be responsible for the first $700, while SGI will pay  the remaining $1,300.  However, if it\u2019s determined that another Saskatchewan driver/owner is responsible  for the damage and that person can be identified, that person\u2019s insurance will pay  for your damage, including your deductible and any other reasonable out-of-pocket  expenses.  Coverage for specific single-vehicle losses Single-vehicle collision \u2013 Your damages are covered for the amount in excess of your  deductible. You may be able to recover your deductible when there is a responsible  party to pursue. Your adjuster will assist you with this. In most single-vehicle collisions  the driver is responsible and must pay their own deductible.  Storm or weather-related damage \u2013 Even though you\u2019re not at fault for weather-  related damage, such as hail damage or a tree falling on your vehicle, the deductible  applies as there is no responsible party to pursue.  Collision with an animal \u2013 If you carry only the compulsory plate insurance, the  deductible applies. If you carry additional auto insurance the deductible may be  waived for a collision with an animal.  Hit and run \u2013 Your damages are covered for the amount in excess of your deductible.  You may be able to recover your deductible if the responsible party is identified. Your  adjuster will assist you with this.  Theft or vandalism \u2013 If you carry only the compulsory plate insurance, the deductible  applies. If the responsible party is identified, you may be able to recover your  deductible. If you carry additional auto insurance the deductible may be waived for  theft of the entire vehicle.  Coverage for multiple-vehicle losses You\u2019re not at fault for the collision \u2013 You don\u2019t pay the deductible in most cases. The  party found at fault for the collision is responsible for your damage, including your  deductible. Once your adjuster has confirmed your coverage, you may have your  vehicle repaired at the autobody shop of your choice.  You\u2019re at fault for the collision \u2013 As the at-fault driver you\u2019re responsible for your full  deductible. Your licence plate insurance will also pay the other driver\u2019s deductible and  cover any damage to their vehicle.  Shared responsibility for the collision \u2013 When two motorists are each found partially  responsible for a collision, both drivers pay a portion of their deductible if their vehicle  is damaged. For example, if you\u2019re found 25% responsible for a collision you pay 25%  of your deductible.  Personal Auto Injury Insurance The Personal Auto Injury Insurance program provides coverage for Saskatchewan  residents injured in automobile collisions anywhere in Canada or the United States.  Coverage provided depends on which of two auto injury products you choose \u2013 No  Fault Coverage or Tort Coverage.  Extended Auto Insurance Basic plate insurance allows you to drive with minimal coverage, but to protect  yourself, your family, your passengers, and your vehicle, you may find you\u2019ll need more  than just the basics. A licensed insurance broker or agent will explain your options  and provide advice on economical ways to obtain the protection you need.  Extended auto insurance can cover your vehicle for replacement cost, pay for the  cost of a rental if your vehicle is damaged, reduce the deductible you pay for damage  to your vehicle and top-up your injury coverage. Most importantly, it increases your  liability from the minimum $200,000.  Despite your efforts to be a good driver, a moment of distraction, tiredness,  inexperience, poor road conditions and many other things can result in major  collisions. You can be sued and held responsible for damages if you\u2019re at fault \u2013 even  if you have No Fault injury coverage. If you don\u2019t have enough insurance or the means  to pay for your defence or the damages caused, you may be expected to pay  a portion of your earnings for many years as a result of lacking enough coverage.

Drivers will progress through the following steps: • A warning letter will be sent to the driver if the first traffic incident (conviction) has an assigned rating of two points or fewer. • If the first traffic incident (conviction, at-fault collision, suspension) has an assigned rating of three to six points, the driver will be required to attend a Traffic Safety Education session.  Each incident thereafter will result in the driver being required to attend further education courses followed by the administrative suspensions: • Defensive Driving course • Driver Improvement training – educates drivers on the responsibilities and consequences associated with driving and encourages safe driving habits • 30-day driver’s licence suspension • 90-day driver’s licence suspension • 180-day driver’s licence suspension • interview and further action For a complete list of offence and driver points, visit our website or call 1-844-TLK-2SGI (1-844-855-2744).  Appeals Drivers can appeal all sanctions, with the exception of the warning letter, Traffic Safety Education session, interview request and manual review to the Highway Traffic Board. The board is independent from SGI and has the authority to uphold, alter the decision, issue a restricted licence and reduce or increase the length of any driver’s licence suspension.  If you change your name and/or address, you must tell SGI within 15 days by writing to us, or at your motor licence issuer’s office. Any changes to name and/or date of birth must be also accompanied by a legal document supporting the change.

If there isn’t a training record on your SGI customer file, you must present your Driver Education Certificate to the driver examiner at the time of your road test. You must schedule your appointment at your nearest examination office. Road test appointments in smaller centres are reserved for local residents only.  Depending on your location, your examiner may use a paper and a clipboard or a digital app on a tablet to score your driving during the road test.  The road test is an evaluation of your ability to safely operate a vehicle. You’ll be tested on: - abiding by road signs along the route - anticipation of potential hazards - backing up - proper lane driving - shoulder checking - starting - stopping - traffic signs and signals - travelling through controlled and uncontrolled intersections - turning - various safe driving practices like speed selection and steering techniques.  When you arrive to your road test, please: - park and turn off your vehicle; - stay in your vehicle and text “Here” if you signed up for text notifications; - make sure your cellphone and ringer/vibrate are on; - have your photo ID ready.  Your examiner will call you at your appointment time to ask some questions and then will come out to meet you. To keep everyone safe, your supervising driver should wait in our waiting room, rather than in our high-traffic parking lot, while you take your road test.  If you have any questions about the test, the examiner will be happy to answer them for you before the test starts.  Note: No pets or passengers, other than examination staff, are permitted in your vehicle during the road test.  A road test will be rescheduled if: - you cannot provide proof of having completed the required driver education (training record on your electronic SGI file or Driver Education Certificate) - you’re late for your appointment - you don’t have the appropriate driver’s licence or have not paid the exam fee - you haven’t held a Class 7 licence for at least nine months - you don’t meet the vision or medical fitness standards - the vehicle you provide for the road test is unsafe or not equipped in accordance with the law. The Driver Examiner will inspect the vehicle before the test begins. The following list of equipment must be in working order, or the test can be rescheduled: - horn - signal lights - brake lights - headlights (as required) - windshield wipers (as required) - working defrost (as required) - seatbelts and airbags - speedometer - one valid licence plate properly attached to the rear of the vehicle - unobstructed windshield - no aftermarket tinting on the windshield or front side windows - functioning driver’s and front passenger’s doors - proper seats - the passenger compartment of the vehicle is not clean or free of strong scent or odour - the vehicle is not the right class for the licence you want  You will fail the road test if you: - exceed the speed limit - are involved in a collision for which you are 50% or more responsible - fail to stop where required - fail to yield to vehicles and pedestrians - fail to wear a seatbelt - disobey traffic lights - fail to follow a request from the examiner - require the assistance of the examiner - make a combination of minor mistakes  At the end of the road test, a complete report will be given to you with all errors explained. If you were unsuccessful, the report will indicate where improvement is required. Depending on how the examiner scored your test, you’ll either get a paper copy of your results or have them emailed to you. The emailed results include links to the online Driver’s Handbook so you can follow up on the areas you need to work on. When you have had more practice, you may make an appointment for another road test. You must pay an additional test fee before each road test.  If you’re applying for a Class 5 licence and fail your road test, you must wait two weeks before you are eligible for another road test. Additional training may be recommended or a longer learning period imposed. Successful exam results are valid for 12 months but your licence must be upgraded at any SGI motor licence issuer before you can drive alone.",

    "title": "BASIC INFORMATION AND RULES OF THE ROAD",
    "content": "The six basic driving conditions  Driver condition refers to your physical, mental and emotional fitness to drive. It’s the most important of the six conditions, because a driver in top physical, mental and emotional shape can adjust to all the other conditions and to the errors of other drivers as well.  Vehicle condition affects your ability to control your vehicle, your ability to see and be seen, and to communicate with other drivers and pedestrians. Your chances of staying out of a collision are better with a vehicle in tip-top condition than they are with one that has operational defects. You are the only one who knows when something isn’t working right. Only you can spot possible vehicle defects and either repair them or get them corrected by a qualified mechanic.  Light condition: The first requirement of safe driving is to see and be seen. This ability is affected by light condition. The presence of natural or artificial light; you can have too little light, or too much light. The hazard of too little light is found in the fact that the nighttime fatal collision rate is more than double the daytime rate.  Weather condition: Bad weather can affect traction, visibility and vehicle control. Rain, snow and ice make road surfaces slippery. Adverse weather can obscure your vision with rain, snow, fog or road splatter, as well, steam up glass with interior vapour. Other drivers find it harder to see you, and pedestrians hide behind umbrellas so they fail to see cars approaching. High winds make steering difficult and cause vehicles to veer to the wrong side of the road.  Road condition refers to the total roadway and the type and condition of the road surface. These can affect your ability to steer, stop and manoeuvre. Adverse road conditions can be produced by weather. Conditions change from one kind of road to another – from a side street to a thoroughfare, from a secondary road to a main highway, from a two-lane road to an expressway. Any trip may involve a number of different road conditions, each requiring an adjustment in your driving.",

        "content": "Traffic condition Traffic conditions are created by the number of vehicles and pedestrians using the same road or street at the same time you are, and to a large extent by how well the road has been engineered to accommodate the amount of traffic present at a given time. More cars mean more conflict in traffic and more chance for a collision. Traffic conditions are influenced by the time of day, day of the week, even time of year in the case of holiday periods, and by the nature of the environment, such as a shopping centre, sports arena, factory or school.  There are speed limits on all Saskatchewan roads, streets and highways. Always drive your vehicle within the posted speed limit. Emergency vehicles responding to an emergency may exceed the speed limit. On most provincial highways, and in urban areas, speed limit signs are posted. In the absence of signs, the speed limit is 80 km/h. Most urban centres post speed limit signs at the entrances to the town or city. Those speed limits apply to all locations within community boundaries, unless otherwise posted. The speed limit means the fastest you can travel under ideal conditions. Stunting and racing can have serious and often life-threatening consequences.  Some of the things that could land you a ticket, licence suspension and impoundment are: • racing side by side with another vehicle while disobeying the speed limit • chasing another vehicle • speeding in and out of lanes to unsafely pass vehicles • attempting to lift some or all tires from the roadway (including driving a motorcycle on one wheel) • attempting to spin a vehicle to cause it to spin or circle • driving a vehicle while not sitting in the driver’s seat • driving your vehicle in a way that prevents another vehicle from passing • stopping or slowing down to interfere with the movement of another vehicle  The maximum speed limit when passing tow trucks or emergency vehicles that are stopped with their lights flashing or when passing Ministry of Highways and Infrastructure equipment with lights flashing, whether in motion or not, is 60 km/h. Within the work zone (road maintenance areas), motorists are required to slow down and travel no faster than the posted speed. Fines for speeding triple when passing highway workers or equipment occupied by a worker in the work zone. Some cities have bylaws requiring drivers to obey work zone speed limits through the entire construction area. Please be familiar with the bylaws in your area. Drivers are also required to reduce their speed to 60 km/h when passing a tow truck stopped on the roadside with its amber or amber and blue lights flashing while it’s assisting to a disabled vehicle.  In school zones drivers must be particularly careful. Each city or town sets speed limits in school zones through local bylaws. As a result, laws vary from place to place so watch for signs. If there are no signs, you should still reduce your speed and proceed cautiously in school zones.",

Photo radar tickets are issued to the registered owner of the speeding vehicle driven through the zone. You must slow down when approaching animals on or near the road. Regardless of the posted or basic speed limit you must never travel faster than conditions allow for safe and reasonable passage. At the same time, travelling too slowly can be hazardous. You should never drive at a speed slow enough to impede or block other traffic, unless proper safety precautions have been taken.  Always drive with care, attention and reasonable consideration for other road users. It’s illegal for you, or any of your passengers, to perform stunts or other activities that distract, startle or interfere with other road users.  Driver inattention and distraction is responsible for 14% of all collisions. On average, it leads to 19 fatalities a year in Saskatchewan (based on an average from 2019 – 2021).  Driving requires you to do more than two things at once – steering, braking, shifting gears and watching for traffic all occur at the same time. When you add distractions like eating, grooming, talking or texting on cellphones, the results can be disastrous. Drivers should devote their full attention to driving. Some of the most common driver distractions include persons, objects or events outside the vehicle, distraction from passengers, looking for or at something in the vehicle, adjusting radio, climate or vehicle controls, smoking and eating or drinking.  You also shouldn’t distract other road users - deliberately creating loud and unnecessary noise with a motor vehicle is not permitted.",

When accelerating up to speed, truck drivers use up to 18 gear changes. Once they get into top gear, they do not appreciate having to start again. Therefore, avoid forcing a truck driver to slow down.  Large trucks will decrease speed when going uphill. You can expect truck drivers to pick up speed when going down hills to help them get up the other side. Plan your passing manoeuvre accordingly.  It takes longer to stop a large truck than a car, so a truck driver needs a longer following distance to be safe and in control. Don’t cut in front of a large truck immediately after you have passed it.  Truck drivers have problems seeing smaller vehicles. Although they have mirrors that help them to see each side, you may not be visible to the driver if you follow too closely. (Besides, you can’t see anything yourself.) Realize that in poor weather, exterior mirrors become spotted with rain and dirt and the truck driver doesn’t have an interior mirror. Be sure to make yourself visible. Drive with your headlights on.  The driver of a large truck or bus has difﬁculty turning sharp corners, particularly to the right. If the driver follows the proper procedure, vehicles facing them on the street they are entering should be prepared for the large truck or bus to enter their half of the roadway. If the large truck operator is not following the proper procedure, vehicles on their right in the street they are leaving should stay well back to avoid being crushed between the large truck and the curb. When you see a large truck or bus making a sharp right turn, give it the room it needs.  All drivers should avoid a large truck’s “no-zone.” The no-zone refers to the blindspot areas around big trucks, where crashes are most likely to occur. Just like cars, large trucks have blindspots on both sides, but a large truck’s are considerably bigger. These blindspots can mean trouble if a trucker decides to change lanes and a car is in the blindspot. In addition to the blindspots on the sides of a large truck, drivers should be careful around the front end of large trucks.  Truckers sit up high and the hood of the cab obscures part of the road ahead. This is why when drivers in a car are passing a large truck, they should make sure they can see the entire truck cab in their rear-view mirror before pulling in front. If a car cuts in too soon, truck drivers are forced to react with little time or room to spare. Large trucks also have deep rear blindspots. A good rule of thumb is that if you can’t see the large truck’s mirrors, the truck driver can’t see you.",

Rear-end collisions are the most frequent type of crash involving school buses and are usually caused by another driver failing to stop while the bus is loading or unloading passengers.  When approaching a school bus, if you see amber ﬂashing lights, slow down and proceed with caution. If the red ﬂashing lights are activated, you must come to a complete stop.

Since motorcycles are more agile than cars, their actions are more difﬁcult to predict and their size makes them hard to see.  Most motorcycles are wired so that their headlights are on at all times, making it easier for you to see them. Be alert for motorcycles that don’t have their headlights on. During motorcycle season, check twice before making a lane change or turn – once for cars and trucks, and once for motorcycles and bikes.  When passing a motorcycle, ensure you leave adequate distance ahead of the motorcycle before you pull back in to the lane. Failure to leave sufﬁcient room can be extremely dangerous for the motorcyclist.  The same three-second following distance should be given to motorcycles as is given to other vehicles. Following too closely may cause a motorcycle rider’s attention to be distracted from the road and trafﬁc ahead.  Motorcyclists are allowed to ride two abreast but most riders prefer to have a full lane width. A skilled motorcyclist is constantly changing positions within a lane to increase his ability to see and be seen, and to avoid objects on the road. Never move into the same lane beside a motorcycle, even if the lane is wide and the motorcyclist is riding to one side. It is not only illegal, it’s extremely hazardous. When overtaking a motorcycle or bicycle in your lane, you must pass in the same manner as you would pass a car.  Bad weather and slippery surfaces cause greater problems for motorcycles than for cars. Allow more following distance for motorcycles when the road surface is wet and slippery. These conditions create stability problems.  Being aware of these situations can help you share the road safely with all cyclists.  New motorcyclists are required to display a Motorcycle Graduated Driver Licensing (MGDL) placard on their licence plate identifying them as new riders. Learners are required to display a red ‘L’ placard and Novice riders must display green ‘N’ placards. Please use caution when passing or following a new rider and give them plenty of space.",

Cyclists must obey the same rules of the road as other vehicles.  Cyclists travelling at a lower speed than other trafﬁc are expected to ride about one metre from the curb or parked cars, or as close as practical to the right-hand edge of the road when there is no curb. • Cyclists are not required to ride close to the right edge of the road when they are travelling at or faster than the normal speed of trafﬁc at that time and place, or when they are turning left, or getting in position to turn left. Bike lanes are reserved for cyclists. Sometimes you will need to enter or cross a bike lane to turn right at a corner or driveway. Take extra care when you do this. Enter the bike lane only after ensuring that you can do so safely, and then make the turn.  When you’re sharing the road with cyclists please remember: • Many children riding bicycles on the street are very young and lack the necessary training and skills for safe cycling. • When passing or overtaking a cyclist, go around them like you would any other vehicle. • Watch for cyclists’ hand signals. A cyclist may indicate a right-hand turn by extending their right arm. If possible, try to make eye contact with cyclists. • When turning left, you must stop and wait for oncoming bicycles to pass before turning. • When driving through an intersection, be careful to scan for cyclists waiting to turn left. • When you’re preparing to make a right turn, watch for cyclists who may pull up alongside your vehicle. Check your blind spots. • When making a right turn, do not pull up beside a cyclist and then turn directly in front of them and cut them off. • When pulling away from the curb always check for cyclists who may be travelling near the right edge of the lane or curb. • When parked at the curb, always check for cyclists when you open your vehicle door. • Give cyclists space with a safe following distance. They do not have brake lights to warn you when they’re slowing or stopping. • Cyclists are entitled to make left turns the same way as motorists. Since they are exposed on left turns, they will need extra consideration, especially on multi-lane roads. • It’s easy to misjudge the speed of bicycles — they can travel faster than you think! Experienced cyclists can travel at 25-35 km/h on a ﬂat surface and up to 50km/h going downhill. • Cyclists are entitled to ride at least one metre from the curb and may ride even further out when they steer away from drainage grates, potholes, debris, loose gravel or sand, wet or slippery surfaces, rutted or grooved pavement and even dogs. Be aware of the roadway conditions that may affect a cyclist. • Don’t use your horn when you’re passing a cyclist. It may frighten them and cause them to steer into your path. If you feel that you must use your horn, tap it quickly and lightly while you are still some distance away from the cyclist.  There’s also a class of bicycle called power-assisted bicycles, commonly known as e-bikes or electric bicycles and many are designed to look like scooters equipped with pedals. These types of vehicles use an electric motor to help the operator up to a maximum speed of 32 km/h. Treat them the same way you would any other cyclist.",

When you’re travelling alone in the centre lane of a road where there are three lanes provided in the direction you’re travelling, all four gates are open to you. This means you can move ahead, slow down and drop back, or move to your right or left, and still continue uninterrupted movement.  If a gate is open you can drive into it whenever you want to. A safe driver always tries to have at least two open gates to provide options for emergency movement.

Shoulder check your blind spot for the gate you’re driving into. For the left side, turn your head left until you are looking along your shoulder. You’re checking to see if there is a vehicle closing your gate. If there is something there, don’t try to move into that space. To check the right side, you need to turn your head to the right.  Watch out for motorcyclists and bicyclists, especially during low light conditions (dusk and dawn) or during periods of inclement weather, as these vehicles are small, fast and very manoeuvrable and may be easy to miss during a shoulder check.  For your own safety and the safety of other motorists, don’t drive in other drivers’ blind spots. Move forward, or drop back, as soon as you notice this situation.

They can already see that you’re turning.  The procedure when you plan to turn or change lanes: 1. Assuming that you know the status of your gates and are properly positioned for the turn, signal. 2. Check your mirror. 3. Shoulder check your blind spot for the gate you are moving into. 4. Start the turn or lane change. 5. Cancel signal once turn or lane change is complete.

In some centres, the lane itself has diamond markings installed in the pavement. On these designated streets, curb lanes are reserved for transit vehicles during the rush hour, or peak driving times. When bus lane hours are in effect, no one is allowed to operate a vehicle, other than a bus or an emergency vehicle, in the designated curb lane, except for the purpose of making a right turn onto, or off of, a street block where a bus lane is in effect. Only buses, emergency vehicles or accessible taxicabs loading or unloading non-ambulatory passengers are allowed to stop in a designated bus lane.  This sign indicates the street you're turning to has a designated lane.  Bicycle-only lanes are dedicated for cyclists and are similar to bus lanes. Vehicles aren't allowed in bicycle-only lanes except for the purpose of making a right turn, accessing a parking space or entering a lane or driveway.  Designated bicycle lanes may be exclusive for bicycle use or shared with motor vehicle traffic. Pavement marking may vary between communities.  A chevron and bicycle symbol designate a shared bicycle or 'sharrow' lane. Sharrows use pavement markings painted on a roadways to encourage cyclists and motorists to share the lane. They are generally intended for use on roadways with lanes that are wide enough for side-by-side bicycle and vehicle operation. However, motorists should always pass cyclists at a safe distance and should not assume that the sharrow indicates that they can pass within the travel lane. Depending on the positioning of the cyclist, it may be necessary to change lanes in order to pass safely.  Sharrows do not designate a bicycle lane and should not be treated as such. While some cyclists will ride down the centre of the arrow, in many locations, the sharrow marking simply indicates cyclists and motorists are to share the lane and isn't an indication of where a cyclist rides within the lane.",

General procedure for right turns: 1. Plan your right turn well in advance. Signal, check your rear gate and check your blind spot. When safe, move as close to the right as possible. 2. Check for traffic, pedestrians and other real or potential hazards in or near the intersection. A basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping pattern will be sufficient. 3. Slow down (shift to a lower gear if driving a manual transmission vehicle). Maintain a suitable speed throughout the turn to allow for proper vehicle control and avoid obstructing traffic. 4. Check again for real or potential hazards. 5. If there are no real or potential hazards, complete your right turn into the first available driving lane.  When a vehicle is parked in the lane closest to the right curb and near the intersection, the driver must move into that lane at the first opportunity before turning, keeping as close to the right curb or edge of the road as possible. Drivers may not make turns from the main driving lane.  Left turns Left turns are more dangerous than right turns because you have to cross traffic coming from at least two directions. This means that your searching pattern is very important and you should continue to search as you cross the intersection. When you intend to turn left across the path of any vehicle approaching from the opposite direction, you must yield the right of way to the oncoming vehicle. When making a left turn, you must approach the intersection and complete the turn in the left-most lane available for your direction of travel.  General procedure for left turns: 1. If a lane change is required, decide well in advance to make your left turn. Signal and check your rear gate and blind spot to see if there is a vehicle close to you. Move safely into the left side of the left lane. 2. Check for traffic, pedestrians and any other real or potential hazards that may be in or near the intersection. Use the basic left, straight ahead, right, left sweeping pattern. 3. Slow down (and shift to a lower gear if you are driving a manual transmission vehicle). 4. Check again for real or potential hazards. Watch out for motorcycles when completing a left turn. Motorists failing to identify oncoming motorcycles when making a left turn is a significant contributing factor in collisions involving motorcycles. 5. If you have to stop in the intersection to wait for oncoming traffic, be sure to keep your vehicle parallel to the lane and your front wheels straight. That way if you're hit from behind, you will not be pushed in the path of oncoming traffic. 6. If there are no potential hazards, complete your left turn into the first available driving lane.  A left turn from a one-way street to a two-way street should be made as close as possible to the left edge of the roadway. If there are no cars parked in the curb lane, you can move into that lane in advance of the corner. If there is a car in the curb lane, be sure the driver is turning and not pulling over to park before entering the lane. When you make your turn onto the two-way street, enter into the lane immediately to the right of the centre line.  For a left turn from a one-way street to a one-way street, start the turn from the left edge of the roadway and complete the turn in the left-most driving lane. When a vehicle is parked in a lane closest to the left curb and near the intersection, the driver must move into that lane at the first opportunity before turning.  For a left turn from a two-way street to a one-way street, turn from the lane next to the centre line and enter the one-way street into the left-most driving lane.",

Use the entrance ramp to make a right turn into the acceleration lane to enter the highway. 2. When safe, signal, check mirrors, shoulder check, and move into the far-left lane for the U-turn. 3. Complete the U-turn into the acceleration lane going in the opposite direction. 4. When safe, signal, check mirrors, shoulder check, and move into the far-right driving lane to continue straight or into the far-right turning lane to complete a right turn. 5. Always shoulder check for lane changes.  Note: Layout and lengths may vary at actual intersections.",

  "content": "Drive within the posted speed limit. Emergency vehicles may exceed the speed limit when responding to emergencies. On most provincial highways and urban areas, speed limit signs are posted; in the absence of signs, the limit is 80 km/h. Most towns and cities post limits at entrances, which apply throughout the community unless otherwise posted. The speed limit is the fastest permitted under ideal conditions.  Stunting and racing are dangerous and can lead to licence suspension or vehicle impoundment. Offences include: • Racing side by side while speeding • Chasing another vehicle • Unsafe speeding in and out of lanes • Driving a motorcycle on one wheel • Causing a vehicle to spin or circle • Driving without sitting in the driver’s seat • Preventing another vehicle from passing • Interfering with another vehicle’s movement  The maximum speed limit when passing stopped emergency vehicles, tow trucks, or Ministry of Highways equipment with lights flashing is 60 km/h. In road work zones, motorists must travel no faster than the posted speed. Fines for speeding triple near workers or occupied equipment. Some cities require compliance with the work zone speed from start to finish; know local bylaws. Reduce speed to 60 km/h near tow trucks assisting disabled vehicles with flashing amber or amber/blue lights.  In school zones, be cautious and reduce speed, following posted limits. These are set by locally bylaw, so watch for signs. If not posted, still proceed slowly and carefully.  Photo radar may be used to enforce speed limits in work zones, school zones, and other high-risk locations. Tickets are issued to the registered owner of the vehicle.  Slow down when approaching animals on or near the road. Never exceed a speed that conditions do not permit for safe passage. Travelling too slowly can also be hazardous.  Never tamper with devices marking stopped vehicles. Always come to a complete stop at stop signs and railway crossings when signals or gates are active. After stopping, proceed only if safe. You must also stop when signaled by police officers or flagpersons.  Observe painted curbs or signs prohibiting parking. If stopping in a traffic lane due to congestion, always stop behind any crosswalk, before entering the intersection.",

When passing a motorcycle, leave adequate space ahead before merging back into the lane to avoid danger. Maintain a three-second following distance behind motorcycles as with other vehicles. Motorcyclists ride two abreast but prefer a full lane width and move within the lane to increase visibility and avoid hazards. Never share a lane side-by-side with a motorcycle, as it is illegal and extremely hazardous. Pass motorcycles as you would other vehicles.  Bad weather and slippery roads pose more risk for motorcycles, so allow more following distance in these conditions.

Exposure to glare from lights requires up to five seconds to recover, increasing with age (sometimes up to 25 seconds). Consult an eye specialist if glare recovery is problematic.

For example, the sign is nine seconds away and at 100 km/h the spaces on the broken lines on the highway disappear about 12 seconds ahead.  Estimate distance ahead in the following way: 1. Pick a stationary object that is on or near the road (for example: a sign, shadow, overpass or pavement patch). 2. Guess how many seconds the object is ahead. 3. Then start counting “thou - sand one, thou - sand two, thou - sand three,” etc. 4. When your front bumper is beside the object, stop counting. This will give you the number of seconds between you and the object chosen. If you guessed 15 seconds and the distance ahead is really eight seconds, then guess a lower number next time. Try for longer distance; see if you can guess how far away 40 seconds is. This way you’ll improve your judgment. 5. Continue practising this exercise until you can judge time accurately. The relationship between time and distance varies with speed. Therefore, begin by making all your judgments at the same speed. Then, practise at other speeds at which you most commonly drive, say 100, 80 and 50 km/h.",

Preventing potential collisions Most collisions occur at intersections and cross roads. To help you spot and prevent a potential collision, use the following method.  Scenario: You’re driving on a road towards an intersection and spot another vehicle approaching the same intersection. You don’t know how fast the other vehicle is travelling or how far away it is from the intersection. To help you determine if a collision is imminent, maintain your speed and course, and turn your head to take note of the other vehicle’s position in relation to you. Continue to maintain your speed and course for a few seconds and check the other vehicle’s position again by turning your head. If the other vehicle is still at the same position, you’re on a collision course. Start slowing down, and be prepared to yield or stop to avoid a collision.  It’s important to turn your head while looking for approaching vehicles and not rely on your peripheral vision only. Peripheral vision is very good at picking out objects that are moving; however, in the above scenario the other vehicle would appear to be not moving as it’s in a fixed position in your peripheral view."

In Saskatchewan, every vehicle occupant must wear a seatbelt where they are provided in a properly adjusted and securely fastened manner. Obey the law and increase your chances of surviving a collision. Put on your seatbelt every time you ride in a vehicle. To be most effective, seatbelts must be used properly. First, put the lap belt on, adjusting it to fit over your pelvis, and pull it snug. The lap belt is designed to take the force on your pelvis – not your stomach. Keep the lap portion low.  Next, adjust the shoulder portion of the seatbelt over your chest area. How you do this will vary from vehicle to vehicle. Some adjust automatically, others work like a window blind. Adjust your shoulder belt to make it snug, yet comfortable. Shoulder belts should never be worn behind your back or under your arm.  Drivers are legally responsible to ensure that passengers under 16 years of age use seatbelts where available and child safety seats, when appropriate. If not, the driver may be charged. Passengers aged 16 years and older are responsible for buckling themselves up.  Being a safety-minded driver means you make sure everyone in your vehicle is properly secured.

To adjust the right side mirror, position your head toward the centre of your vehicle. Adjust the mirror so it shows just a sliver of the right side of your vehicle.  By setting mirrors so the driver can see both sides of the vehicle from the driving position, the same image will appear in all three mirrors. By setting them so the driver has to lean to see the sides of the car, the outside mirrors continue on where the inside mirror leaves off – significantly reducing the blind spot.

To shift to a lower gear - push the accelerator to the floor. This technique is used for passing or to get out of an emergency situation quickly.  When driving down a steep hill, you can slow your vehicle by manually shifting to a lower gear and using engine compression as a braking effect. Simply move the gear shift lever from the drive “D” position to the next lower gear (usually third or second gear). It is recommended to make your gear selection at the top of the hill before you start going down. If you have to make the shift while driving down the hill, release the accelerator and use your brake to slow the vehicle down before moving the shift lever. To avoid engine damage, pay attention to ensure that the rpm’s stay out of the red zone as you shift to a lower gear. You should use the brakes only as needed.

Check your surroundings:    • Always check behind your vehicle before backing up.    • Children, pets, bicycles, wagons, etc., aren’t always visible from inside your vehicle.    • Make sure the path is clear before you start backing up. 2. Prepare your vehicle:    • All backing manoeuvres should begin with the vehicle straight and the front wheels straight.    • Adjust your mirrors and ensure your backup camera (if equipped) is clean and operational. 3. Using the backup camera:    • Check all angles — while backup cameras are helpful, they don’t capture everything. Always turn your head to look out the rear window and check in all directions.    • Mirrors and camera — use your mirrors in conjunction with the backup camera to get a comprehensive view of your surroundings. 4. Proper positioning for backing:    • From your normal seating position, shift your weight so that you’re resting on your right hip.    • Support yourself by placing your right arm along the armrest or the top of the front passenger seat.    • Grasp the top centre (12 o’clock position) of the steering wheel with your left hand. 5. Starting to back up:    • While looking out the rear window, begin backing slowly in a straight line. Within the first foot or so of vehicle movement, check forward. If the front of the vehicle is moving straight back, your front wheels are straight. If the front of the vehicle swings to the left or right, your wheels are not straight.    • If the front of your vehicle swings to the left, turn your steering wheel to the left to straighten. If the front swings to the right, turn your steering wheel to the right to straighten. Once you get the wheels straight, move your grip to the new 12 o’clock position.    • Having done this, you know that every time your hand is at 12 o’clock, your front wheels are straight.  6. Focus and control:    • Look through the rear window and focus your eyes well back along the path you want to go.    • Move the vehicle slowly backward. Look and steer where you want to go.    • You’ll notice that the vehicle turns much more when you are backing because the front wheels are pivoting, or swinging, around the rear wheels. This is called ‘front end swing’ and is the cause of many backing collisions.  Additional tips for using technology • Backup sensors: Many vehicles are equipped with backup sensors that alert you if you’re getting too close to an object. Pay attention to these alerts but do not rely solely on them. • 360-degree cameras: Some vehicles offer a 360-degree view, which can provide a better overall perspective. Use this feature to enhance your situational awareness. • Blind spot monitoring: Utilize any blind spot monitoring systems to assist in detecting vehicles or objects that you might not see when backing up. By combining these technologies with proper visual search patterns and cautious driving, you can significantly reduce the risk of collisions while backing up. Remember, technology is there to assist you, but your primary focus should always be on visually confirming your surroundings and backing up safely."

Palming (precision backing technique)    Palming is an advanced steering technique that’s only used when backing. It’s used in situations where both straight line backing and sharp turning are required. This method allows you to turn the wheel sharply while ensuring that your front wheels will be straight when your hand is at 12 o’clock. Put your left hand at the 12 o’clock position but do not grasp the wheel. Instead, push your palm against the rim of the wheel with enough pressure so that when you move your hand down and around, the wheel turns, but your palm stays on the same place on the wheel rim."

      "title": "Estimation of safe passing time",
      "content": "Using time to estimate when you can pass is complicated, but it’s well worth the effort required to master it. You can practise passing safely and once you can judge time well, you have a good method of judging when it’s safe to pass.  You can get all the information you need to make a passing judgment from two estimates: the estimate of your safe passing time and the estimate of the closing time between you and the approaching vehicle.  The first step in developing your new technique is to find out how long it normally takes you to pass. This varies from 10 to 40 seconds depending on your vehicle, your technique and the difference in speed between you and the vehicle you are passing. To find your safe passing time, choose a divided highway or a two-way highway at a time and place when traffic is light.  First, determine your passing time as follows: 1. Follow the vehicle ahead at the same speed, but three seconds back. Note its speed. 2. Check that you can see at least 40 seconds ahead, that there are no vehicles coming the other way and that there are no intersections or solid lane markings. 3. Begin counting “Thou - sand one, Thou - sand two” from the point you decide to pass and begin to accelerate. 4. Signal, and at a point where you still have good vision and can smoothly change lanes around the vehicle ahead, move into the left lane. 5. Continue in the left lane until you see the vehicle you have just passed in your inside mirror. As you pull back into your original lane, signal right and continue your acceleration. Do not decelerate as you change lanes. 6. Continue counting until you have completed your pass. Stop your count when your left rear wheel crosses the lane line (just as you are returning to your original lane in front of the vehicle you have passed). 7. The last number you say after “Thou - sand” is your measure of passing time in seconds.  Next, build in a safety margin that you are comfortable with.  Five seconds is a minimum safety margin. For example, if your passing time is 15 seconds, add another five seconds for possible error. This will give you a cushion of five seconds if the vehicle coming towards you is approaching faster than normal or if your estimation is not accurate."

For example, watch a vehicle pass and note where it pulls back into the driving lane. 3. When an approaching vehicle appears, start counting and continue counting until the vehicle reaches the safe return point ahead of you.

When a vehicle is approaching, decide if it is safe to pass or not.

Keep practising until you can make the safe/unsafe judgment with 100% accuracy.  There are two advantages to practising your passing judgment in this way. First, it is completely safe because you never actually pass the vehicle. Second, your timing will be based on the actual speeds of vehicles using the highway.  Be sure to keep the type and size of vehicle you are passing in mind. For instance, when passing a motorcycle make sure you leave a greater distance between your vehicle and the motorcycle you are passing, before pulling back into the driving lane. It’s easy to underestimate how much room you should allow due to the smaller size of a motorcycle."

Any speed or steering adjustments required while in the curve should be very gradual to avoid losing control of your vehicle.  The most important part of driving a curve or corner is to slow down before you get to it.  To drive around a sharp curve or corner, follow this procedure: 1. Slow down. Take your foot off the accelerator and, if necessary, brake. It’s important to brake in a straight line. 2. In a manual transmission vehicle, shift to a lower gear so that you have enough power to accelerate through the curve or corner. 3. Use the vision techniques on page 90. 4. Use your accelerator gently until you reach the mid-point of the curve, pushing down on the accelerator if you want the vehicle to go to the outside of the curve.

Unlike main highways, these roads are not designed to help you to get out of trouble if you happen to be travelling faster than the posted speed limit. The speed limits are to be taken seriously and should be regarded as maximums under ideal conditions. When there is no posted speed limit, the speed limit is 80 km/h under ideal conditions.  Gravel surfaces may cause problems. At times, the gravel may be deep and loose, making it difficult to steer around curves. At other times there may be so little gravel that you’re actually driving in dirt, which is very slippery when wet.  When dry, gravel surfaces also create visibility problems. Every moving vehicle creates clouds of dust that make meeting and passing other vehicles very dangerous.  Railway crossings, crossroads and farm entrances are more difficult to see on these roads than when you’re driving on provincial highways that provide better sight distances.

      "title": "Driving on slippery surfaces",
      "content": "Winter traction problems require a number of changes from summer driving techniques. The general rule for driving on slippery conditions is drive slowly. You should not use cruise control on icy or slippery roads. This is even more important when the road may have black ice formed on it (a thin layer of transparent ice found on the road or other paved surfaces). Traction varies tremendously with temperature changes. Icy roads will look just the same at -2 C or -22 C, but will be far more slippery at the warmer temperature. Winter driving calls for special driving skills. This means gentle acceleration, gentle braking and small, smooth steering movements. Reduced traction means the grip between your tires and the slippery surface is fragile. If you accelerate hard, you go beyond the amount of traction that is available and your wheels spin. If you brake too hard and your wheels lock, you break the traction, which means that when you turn the steering wheel, the vehicle will not turn – it will continue in the direction it was going when the wheels locked. If this occurs on ice, your stopping distance changes. In most situations, locking four wheels by pushing hard on the brakes will give you the shortest stopping distance. But on ice, especially when it’s near the freezing point or if you are driving fast, you are better off to threshold-brake by pushing on the brake up to the point just before it locks. If the surface is slippery, flatten the corner or curve by positioning your vehicle in the left side of your lane prior to making your turn. As you enter the curve, gradually steer across the lane so that as you near the midpoint of the curve the vehicle is near the right side of the lane with its wheels straight. As you exit the curve, gradually steer back across the lane towards the left side. For left curves, reverse the process. This will lessen the sideways force and reduce the chance that you will spin out. Slow entry into the curve is crucial or your vehicle may not make it around the curve. Because there is reduced traction available for stopping and turning, reduce your speed when conditions are wet or slippery. As well, give yourself a following distance even longer than three seconds. Never use cruise control when roads are wet or slippery."

When your wheels spin, immediately stop accelerating and hold the vehicle with the brake to stop it from rolling back. Shift to reverse, release the brake and accelerate gently. You will move back. When the wheels spin again, stop immediately. Repeat the forward-backward rocking movement, increasing the distance you move each time until you gain sufficient momentum to keep moving ahead. Be sure the wheels have stopped turning before changing gears to avoid damage to your transmission. Search for traction. Look for sand or grit. Choose snow rather than ice.

  "title": "Braking",
  "content": "The general procedure for braking is to begin early, apply light pressure and ease up on the brake as the vehicle comes to a stop. Always brake with your right foot. If you want to stop more quickly, push the brake down a little further. Remember, for normal braking you control the stop by varying the pressure. Do not push the brake down as far as it will go. Anti-lock Braking System (ABS) – was introduced in the mid-1980s and has become standard equipment on most newer vehicles. It was designed to help drivers maintain some steering ability and avoid skidding while braking. In normal braking, ABS is not activated. During hard braking, vehicles with ABS remain stable. The brakes do not lock up, which means the driver has more steering control. How do you use ABS? Press the brake firmly and do not release until the vehicle has stopped. Do not pump your brakes; the ABS is doing it for you. When the ABS is active, the brake pedal may pulsate and the car may shudder or emit clunking noises. This can startle some drivers, causing them to release the brake, but these things are normal and indicate the ABS is functioning properly. You may think that with ABS you can stop on a dime. This instantaneous stop is not realistic. When braking on dry or wet roads your stopping distance will be about the same as with conventional brakes. You should allow for a longer stopping distance with ABS than with conventional brakes when driving on gravel, slush and snow. This is because the rotating tire will stay on top of this low-traction road surface covering and effectively float on this layer. A non-ABS-braked vehicle can lock its tires and create a snow plow effect in front of the tires that may, in some cases, help slow the vehicle. These locked tires can sometimes find more traction below this layer. It’s recommended you refer to your vehicle owner’s manual to become familiar with proper practices should your vehicle have electronic stability control, traction control, or other safety features.",

To accomplish this, shift to neutral (declutch) and brake until you feel one or more wheels lock, then, ease up the brake slightly until the wheels are all rolling again. Re-apply pressure until you feel one of the wheels start to lock up, ease off slightly and continue this movement, tracking the threshold until you stop. As the vehicle slows, you can brake harder before lock-up will occur. The more slippery the surface, the less you will be able to push the brake before a wheel locks. The skill in threshold braking comes from being able to linger just short of lock-up. To threshold brake well requires much effort and concentration. While it’s usually the technique of choice, it is almost impossible to do if you panic."

    {
      "title": "Four-wheel lock braking",
      "content": "With this technique, you shift to neutral (declutch) and then hit the brakes very hard so that all four wheels lock at the same time. Since most cars aren’t designed to do this, you need to stomp on the brake pedal and keep maximum pressure on the brake until you come to a complete stop. Your vehicle will travel in a straight line. If all four wheels do not lock at exactly the same time, or if the surface under different tires varies, the vehicle may rotate a little before it finally stops. Even under the worst conditions (one wheel on ice, one wheel on dry pavement), the vehicle will travel in a straight line, although it may revolve around a point in the middle of the vehicle. You need very little pressure to lock the wheels on ice. As the traction increases, you must increase the pressure to lock the wheels. On dry pavement, you really have to stomp on the brake to lock all four wheels simultaneously. You must also be seated sufficiently close to the brake pedal to get the leverage required. The four-wheel lock will produce the shortest stopping distance on all surfaces, except glare ice. It’s also an ideal technique to use if you panic because stomping on the brake is a natural reaction. Also, once you stamp on the brake, you do not have to do anything except keep pressure on the brake. If possible, try the four-wheel lock when you are with a trained instructor. Otherwise, practise at low speeds (20 - 40 km/h) on a wet surface. If you try this procedure on dry pavement, you may damage your tires, which is acceptable if you’re trying to avoid a crash, but not recommended if you are just practising."

      "content": "The difference between steering in an emergency situation and steering in a normal driving situation is the speed and amount that you need to turn the wheel. If you do skid and need to recover, turn the wheel to correct your direction of travel. This method just takes practise. The difficult part is knowing when your wheels are straight. At higher speeds, use the “9 and 3” steering method. Twist the wheel without moving your hands on the wheel. When your hands return to 9 and 3, you know your front wheels are straight. Steering around an object involves three movements: Steer – Twist the wheel in the direction you wish to go. Counter-steer – Turn the wheel back the other way beyond the centrepoint. Straighten out – Twist the wheel back to the point where your wheels are straight. Timing is crucial, so it’s advisable to practise this manoeuvre with an experienced instructor. It’s important, after turning around an obstacle, to get the vehicle going straight before you begin a second steering movement. If your choice is between braking or steering, choose to steer. You can steer around an obstacle in a shorter distance than it takes to stop in front of it."

Regardless of the method of braking you use, take your foot off the brake to steer around the object. Most importantly, do one thing at a time, either brake or steer. If your wheels are locked, the car will go straight ahead regardless of how you turn the steering wheel. If you are driving a vehicle equipped with ABS, the best way to deal with an emergency is to brake hard and steer where you want to go."

It’s a simple procedure as long as you don’t steer very much. You should, however, grip the wheel tightly.

To drive down the ditch, hold the wheel firmly. Look and steer gently down the slope to where you want to go. Stay off the brake. Gradually release the accelerator. If you need to steer to avoid an obstacle, do it slowly and gradually and, if you have a choice, choose the direction that will send you down the slope. If you suddenly find yourself going into a ditch, do not over-react. Try to resist doing anything until you think about what you must do. You’re better off to do nothing than to try the wrong thing. It’s perfectly all right to drive in a ditch to avoid a rollover, provided you don’t hit an approach road or something hard. The main cause of rollovers is attempting to return to the road too early.

If possible, move to the shoulder and turn on your hazard lights. Take a moment to regain your composure and then assess the damage to your vehicle. • Don’t approach the animal, especially if it appears to be wounded. Injured animals can be dangerous. • Call the police or your local RCMP detachment if there are human injuries or significant damage to your vehicle.

Judgment The first part of the body affected by alcohol is the brain, particularly the part of the brain that allows you to think clearly and make good decisions. Its sedative effect impairs judgment in a way that is usually not noticed by the drinker. The part of the brain that controls social inhibitions is also affected, causing people to say and do things they normally would not. These effects start with one drink. 2. Muscle control The second part of the body affected by alcohol is muscle control. Due to the small muscles in the eye being very susceptible to the effects of alcohol, vision can be significantly affected, even at low alcohol levels. Many people wrongly assess their ability to drive after drinking by observing physical dexterity (staggering, etc.). This is incorrect as the greatest percentage of alcohol-related collisions result from faulty thinking during the identification, prediction and decision parts of the driving task and not as a result of poor execution (steering, braking, etc.). The brain functions that are first affected by alcohol consumption are not only important to our ability to drive safely, but are the same ones required to make rational decisions about not driving after drinking. For this reason, you must make the decision to separate your drinking and driving and make the necessary alternate transportation plans before you have that first drink! It doesn’t make sense to drive after drinking. For more information on the effects of alcohol and drugs, contact your nearest Alcohol and Drug Services office.",

Higher doses of amphetamines often make people hostile and aggressive. If you think drug taking has little, or even a positive impact on your driving, you could be tragically mistaken. It’s important to bear in mind that it can be hard to determine exactly how a drug will affect your driving ability – impairment caused by drugs can vary according to the individual, drug type, dosage, the length of time the drug stays in your body, or if the drug has been taken with other drugs or alcohol.

However, if that person already has another drug in their system, the impairing effect on the functioning of the central nervous system (brain) is far greater than the impairing effect of the alcohol and the impairing effect of the other drugs combined; it’s not a simple adding together of impairment, but rather a multiplier effect! This is the synergistic effect! What it means is that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, or 1 + 1 = more than two. When combining drugs and alcohol it causes a multiplying effect. This has an unpredictable effect on driving and can be deadly. Perhaps a few real life examples would be helpful to understand this synergistic effect. Assume that a drink is: • 1 bottle of regular alcohol content beer; or • 5 ounces table wine; or • 3 ounces fortified wine (port or sherry); or • 1-1/2 ounce hard liquor (rye, rum, vodka etc.). Combined with: • anti-depressants • gravol • antihistamines • valium We find that there is a predictable synergistic effect related to the level of impairment caused by a certain number of drinks when combined in this manner. It must be noted that the dosage of the drug will have a serious effect on the “equivalence to number of drinks” estimates. Hydroponically grown marijuana, for example, is much stronger than the light dosage drug used in compiling the figures for this chart. In all cases, the Intoxilyzer reading would indicate just the blood alcohol level caused by two drinks, but the actual impairment of central nervous system function would be equivalent to a much higher blood alcohol level.

If a driver is found to be criminally impaired, the consequences are more severe, and apply to all drivers.",

An ignition interlock device prevents you from operating a vehicle if you have alcohol in your body. A device is installed in the vehicle that is connected to the vehicle’s ignition that checks for the presence of alcohol in the driver. The driver must blow into the machine to start the car, and continue to periodically blow into the device to keep the car in motion. If the device senses alcohol, the car will not start. If while in motion the device senses alcohol the horn will start honking and headlights will flash to draw attention to the vehicle. These cannot be stopped until the vehicle is turned off. The ignition interlock special restricted licence is mandatory for the following: Your conviction was for impaired driving, driving while equal to or over the legal limit for alcohol or a combination of alcohol and drugs, or for failing to comply with a demand. You received a third roadside suspension within the last 10 years and it’s alcohol-related. (Note: If you received your first two roadside licence suspensions as a new driver, those count towards the number of offences as an experienced driver.) The ignition interlock special restricted licence is voluntary for the following: You received a second roadside licence suspension as a new driver within the last 10 years. You received an indefinite roadside administrative suspension for an alcohol-related Criminal Code offence and you’ve served at least 90 days of your suspension. The device must remain in the vehicle until the ignition interlock suspension period ends. You cannot wait out your suspension period. Eligibility and program duration: The Ignition Interlock program is mandatory for certain impaired driving offences, the length of the mandatory term depends on how many prior offences the driver has in the past 10 years, and the type of impaired driving offence. You’re not eligible for early reinstatement of your driving privileges by installing an ignition interlock device if you’ve been declared ineligible by a judge, your conviction is not alcohol-related, or because you’ve been convicted under the Criminal Code of Canada for any impaired driving offence causing bodily injury or death. Special restricted driver’s licence: A restricted driver’s licence limits when and where you can drive. You may be granted a restricted licence if you demonstrate that: the licence suspension would cause you exceptional hardship; allowing for a restricted licence would not be contrary to public interest. You’re eligible to apply to the Highway Traffic Board for a special restricted licence if the following applies to you: Your conviction is non-alcohol/drug related and you have served the entire court-ordered prohibition period and completed the required educational program.

Under this program, drivers are assigned points every time they are convicted of a traffic offence or have an at-fault collision. Drivers who reach their maximum threshold of points are sent a warning letter to advise that tougher sanctions will follow should their driving record continue to deteriorate. Drivers who continue their high-risk behaviour face consequences that include fines, driver's licence re-testing, driver's licence suspensions of up to six months and completion of a driver improvement training program.

"title": "Fuel-efficient driving techniques",
"content": "Safety should be your number one concern every time you get behind the wheel of a vehicle. The good news is that practising fuel-efficient driving techniques not only improves road safety, it also reduces fuel consumption and cuts exhaust emissions that contribute to climate change and urban smog. Depending on your driving habits and how often you drive, these basic techniques and useful tips could save you hundreds of dollars a year in fuel and maintenance costs: - It’s both safer and more fuel efficient to maintain a steady speed on a road. Accelerate smoothly when passing or merging with faster traffic and avoid hard braking. European tests have shown that aggressive driving, including frequent rapid acceleration and hard braking, can increase fuel consumption by approximately 40%. - Drive at the posted speed limit. Lowering your highway cruising speed from 120 km/h to 100 km/h will reduce fuel consumption by up to 20%. - Plan your trips to combine errands and to avoid traffic jams, steep hills, road construction, etc. Combining a number of short trips into one longer one allows your engine and drivetrain to reach peak operating temperature, which is not possible on trips of less than 5 km. Avoiding trouble spots shortens your travel time and reduces unnecessary idling. - If you are driving a vehicle with a manual transmission, learn how to use it properly for maximum fuel savings. A tachometer can help you shift the transmission at the most fuel-efficient engine speeds (the owner’s manual will indicate these speeds). - If you have cruise control, use it for highway driving to maintain a constant speed. The exception is on hilly terrain, where it’s a good idea to allow the vehicle’s speed to drop slightly going uphill and then let gravity help you build up speed again (to a safe level) going down the other side. - In summer, minimize your use of air conditioning. Operating an air conditioner in hot weather can increase fuel consumption by more than 20% in city driving. A more fuel-efficient option for staying cool is to open a window. However, at highway speeds, use your car’s flow-through ventilation – open windows and sunroofs increase aerodynamic drag, which makes the engine work harder and consume more fuel. If you must use your vehicle’s air conditioning, avoid running it continuously. Shut it off after the interior is cool or set the controls to a comfort level that allows the system to cycle. - Check tire pressure at least once a month when the tires are cold (i.e., the vehicle has been stationary for at least three hours or has not been driven more than 2 km). If you have to drive more than 2 km to add air, check the tires before you leave and then add the amount of air that is missing from this reading. Inflate the tires to the recommended pressure, usually indicated on the car door, glove compartment or in the owner’s manual. With proper tire inflation, your car will burn less fuel and be safer to drive. A vehicle with tires that are under-inflated by a total of 10 psi increases fuel consumption by 5%. - Use a block heater in the winter to warm the engine oil and make cold starts easier on your engine components. Your vehicle’s oil doesn’t freeze when the temperature dips below 0˚C, but it does get much thicker. This means your engine has to work harder and use more fuel. Use a timer to switch the block heater on two hours before you plan to drive. Proper use of a block heater can improve your vehicle’s overall fuel economy by as much as 10%. Still, don’t leave your block heater on overnight or your energy savings will disappear in a higher electricity bill. - Follow the vehicle manufacturer’s recommended operating procedures and maintenance schedule in your owner’s manual. Regular maintenance such as oil and filter changes will not only prevent early degeneration of your vehicle’s components, it will also keep them operating at their most fuel-efficient level. A clogged air filter can increase fuel consumption by up to 10%. Regular maintenance will keep your vehicle operating safely, save you money and, at the same time, help the environment. - Remote car starters are handy on cold winter mornings, but don’t start your car too soon. In most driving conditions, today’s modern engines need less warm-up time even on cold mornings.
